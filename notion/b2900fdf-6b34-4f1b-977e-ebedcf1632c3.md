# i-Golem


The Hunter knew the sign, the golem was running amok

when He saw the metal design, He knew the robot was  a new blueprint, bespoke !

Not for protection, but for surveillance.

Instead of the usual sanction*, which would turn it into mud. With a lot of patience,

He welded a change on the head**, turning IRIS -the all mighty watcher- into SIRI.

Alas it must be said, the Golem since talks non-sense to any one within ear reach.





Notes:

*: golem could be deactivated by removing the [aleph](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph) (א) in emét, changing the inscription from "truth" to "death" (mét [מת](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%AA#Hebrew), meaning "dead"). - source Wikipedia
