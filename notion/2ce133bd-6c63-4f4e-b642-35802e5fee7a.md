# The number of god


Seydou was a soft man capable of explosive bursts of energy when playing football or when teaching maths to under grads and post docs  in Yamoussoukro EMY (École de Mathématiques de Yamoussoukro).

The only thing that would bring him down was what he called the number of God which some however called Seydou’s number.

As a maths wiz he had tried to setup the Guiness record for the longest mental calculation. After first attempting to beat the long held 2021 record of 12 digits - held for decades by an 11 year old boy - he succeeded at the age of 10 with a 20 digits mental arithmetic multiplication.
