# “Thaird” lockdown 


After the third lockdown it became clear to everyone the virus could not be eradicated from Earth.

The virus which had escaped from the openAI labs had contaminated all devices around the world.

While resetting devices could get rid of it the AI virus it only lasted until a contaminated device was around.

Some countries had tried to lockdown their internet access and force whole country to rest everything, but there was always someone who had left say a smartphone in a draw  or a smartwatch charging over a weekend…
