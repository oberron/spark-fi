# Qui es muira ! (en)


Amphitrite, the dean of this Greek village of fishermen, had supervised many fishermen's funerals and understood only too well the pain of Thetis, this woman and mother of three who came to join the too large ranks of those whom the Aegean Sea had widowed.

However, when Thetis spoke, the village was surprised by the anger in the voice of this frail woman who until then had always held her opinions back.

"The sea takes us so many of our dear ones not out of carelessness - because it loves us - nor out of anger - although it has the right to do so »

The village was struck, what did she mean, before any could raise their voice, she carried on

« but out of love! 

Indeed we are not dust! 

And so we must not become dust again!

‘quia pulvis es, et in pulverem reverteris’ is a lie

 The people of Rome have robbed us of our heritage"

Another short break and somehow every one was listening even more cautiously 



"We are mainly brine (salt water), so it is normal to go back to the sea"

Then she started chanting

"Qui es muira" (we are made of Brine)

And without knowing why nor how the village responded at once

"IN MURIAM REVERTERIS" (and we will return to the sea)

…

Poseidon had just declared war onto Zeus, his brother!
