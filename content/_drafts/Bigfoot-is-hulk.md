many years ago thy great-great... grand father `Banner` insulted Athenna goddess of wisdom

She cursed him over 30 genrations
Every generation might still be as clever as their ancestor, but once angered they would turn huge, green and unable to think...

Scared the ancester ran to finally find shelter in Hymalayas, where he learned Yoga to control his anger
The knowledge was passed from generation to generation

But locals, over those eons built the legend of `Bigfoot`.

The green skin color hidden after a few generations when they learned how to build capes which would not be destroyed should they be angered.
