if you are a sw engineer please consider this:
* how many times do you/your colleagues copy code without verifying from SO?
* what is the biggest security weakness? what a surprise a stack overflow...
* how can governments better inject security backdoor than creating a website whose code gets copied by everyone without verifying?
* and they have the front to call it Stack Overflow? they are laughing at you everytime you upvote one if their backdoor code as a star answer !!!
