   <h1>Neo Genesis (en)</h1>
<p>When Adam and Eve were cast out of Eden, sorrow filled the air like ash from a great fire. Amongst the animals, three felt a stirring— they had most played with the children of Adam and Eve and felt purpose to protect the innocence of children.</p>
<p>First came the Mouse. Small and quiet, she had listened to the rustle of leaves and the whispers of stars, and now she listened to something deeper—the soft cries of children born into a harder world. “They will lose so much,” she murmured, “even the teeth from their smiles.” And so she crept beyond Eden’s golden borders, unseen but ever present. Where a child’s tooth was lost, she would visit, not to take but to teach: Faith ni the futuure, rhere is more coming—stronger, truer things often grow from what is shed. In time, she left tiny gifts, whispers of encouragement, nudges for faith in future change. And thus, the first of the three began her watch. Her name has been lost for aeons. In places, as she very shy she is now believed to be the tooth fairy.</p>
<p>Next came the Rabbit, fur as white as the clouds over Eden’s highest trees. She had seen how spring always followed winter, how even the barest tree would bud again. “Children will fear the cold, the dark, and the waiting,” she said. “I will go and show them that sweetness hides, even in hard times.” She bounded into the fields beyond the gates, and wherever she went, she buried tokens—painted shells, sugar-bright eggs, sweet things tucked into shadows—teaching the little ones to seek joy and believe in rebirth. Hope, she taught, is not idle—it hops, it hides, it returns. And so the second took her place among the seasons protector of children’s Hope. Her name, though forgotten by the children of Men, has been replaced by her nickname: the « Easter Bunny ».</p>
<p>Last came the Deer, tall and silent, whose eyes held the reflection of starlight and frost who had learned flying with angels. He saw the longest night, and how fear clung in the hearts of children when the sun stayed away. “I will be their guide through winter,” he said, “I will carry the promise of joy upon my antlers, and let them know the light is not gone, only harder to find. But once found, grows as it shared” And he did just that, leaping through snow and sky alike. Over time, the deer found others who shared his mission and shared much back too, but none quite like a curious old man in red, whose laugh shook the cold from the air. The deer, whose nose sometimes glowed with the fire of purpose, chose him—a partner in Charity, delivering joy when the world seemed darkest, his friend loud voice compensating fire his contemplative nature.</p>
<p>His name is still known to us, as his loud friend often yells it : Rudolph the red nose deer 🎶.</p>
<p>Thus, the Three Who Left Eden carried not just gifts, but reminders:</p>
<p>Faith is knowing that loss is followed by growth.</p>
<p>Hope is knowing that waiting brings reward.</p>
<p>Charity is that even in the darkest hour, sharing joy will bring many returns.</p>
<p>And to this day, they still wander—faithfully watching, waiting, whispering hope and sharing happiness to all kids of Humans.</p>
