# The curse on computer's birth

"I wish for every human, a genie, to grant each of our wishes."
- So be it, this was your last wish, computers will soon do  everything you ask them to do" answered the genie.
" But, asked Turing, how will humanity ensure they do what we want?"
"You'll be able to talk to them soon" laughed the genie "and as for doing what you want, we never did either" sniggered the last genie on Earth as he disapeared in a puff of smoke.

- Extract from the first page of Alan Turing's secret diary,
2 days after publishing his foundational paper on artificial intelligence
A. M. Turing (1950) Computing Machinery and Intelligence. Mind 49: 433-460.
