&lt;p&gt;So right after God destroyed the tower, and divided their language, they rebelliously set schools to learn each others language. Quickly realising this was easiest if they used the Aleph-Bet song as a mutual ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So God sent one last Angel to muddle the song in their minds. Besides the first two words nothing made sense anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon they could only remember having to learn the alpha-bet at school but had forgotten why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they spread around the earth, but even eons later their heirs still go to school to learn the alphabet singing “A B C🎶”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two big civilisation compete across the galaxy. One seeks to free life of any constraints so it can explore newer frontiers as much as possible, while the other wishes to put create order everywhere to bring stability. Both aware they share the same goal, but bent on having their own way to dominate, as both equally fear that life without their enlighted guidance might end up being destroyed by their fiercest most mortal enemy: the Void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Earth they both sent agents eons ago to ensure sapient life which was emerging would join their respective camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Order agents seemed at first to score many points and even a hat trick: First humans started using words and put life into boxes, then those boxes were captured in books further reducing the potential for free flow and then what seemed at first to be a hat trick humans wrote SW which left no space left for any free flow nor any room for interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Chaos agents had a plan, they seeded the idea of storing SW on DNA … Soon SW had to learn to deal with random mutuation, genetic algorithms prevailed and the balance between Chaos and Order was restored !&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="notion"></category></entry><entry><title>Dusty broom</title><link href="https://oberron.github.io/spark-fi/dusty-broom.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-20T07:24:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-20T07:24:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Oberron</name></author><id>tag:oberron.github.io,2024-04-20:/spark-fi/dusty-broom.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Dusty broom&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, a radio astronomical research agency) notification alarm rang, it created havoc in the dorms. Nearly a year of sleepless nights searching for the extraterrestrial reading, they realised the sensors had been triggered by a leaky microwave oven, in the rest room near the sensing room.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when it rang again, almost on the day of the anniversary of the first alarm. Every one thought it was a bad joke. However they quickly realised the sensors were actually, partially powered off for maintenance and so should not have triggered an alarm at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So began  a decade long scientific investigation. For budget reasons, it was nearly stopped a dozen times. Yet, years later humanity made first contact with an unknown very refined civilisation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient Chinese had called them &lt;strong&gt;"鬼" (guǐ)&lt;/strong&gt;, ancient Mesopotamia “gidim” and Western Europeans referred to them as ghosts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most visible members of those neighbours had simply, for millennia, been mistaken by humans as our dead ones…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long mission was launched to find the ship on the unfriendly Venus. But then, when they saw the signs of damage which could not be explained neither by atmospheric entry, nor by asteroids, Humanity realised  grave dangers were lurking out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team assembled struggled to make any sense of what they found, until Camille a young scientist, truly the Champolion of this era realised they didn’t use arithmetics.  They seem to use knots and topology as the base for everything, and then still a weird version which only some strangely trained deep neural networks could replicate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="notion"></category></entry><entry><title>Vaccine cover</title><link href="https://oberron.github.io/spark-fi/vaccine-cover.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-06T16:02:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-06T16:02:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Oberron</name></author><id>tag:oberron.github.io,2024-04-06:/spark-fi/vaccine-cover.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Vaccine cover&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A crisis team was formed on how to best mitigate the impact in the share holders value and keep stock prices rising. For weeks they worked round the clock going through different scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until one evening, late into the night, a junior in charge of bringing pizzas saw the board, paused and innocently asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about finding a way to force everyone to be injected  with a vaccine which would have similar side effect? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could have a contract protecting the labs from class action under national emergency laws and then they could not sue us either for the lab leak since no one could prove if damages were from vaccine or virus !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the first reports emerged in 2020, after the third lockdown, that social media were addictive for teenagers and young adults; Few sought compensation from Facebook and its peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decade later, when it became accepted that addiction was only a facet of those effects and lowering inhibitions for anger - What had been so far only considered as trolling - became accepted evidence that social media belonged to the hard drugs camp, social media became slowly a regulated ecosystem for adults only (on the paper).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But shortly later after, it started becoming apparent that those were desired effects and very much designed in from the beginning in those social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed FaceBook AI, which had reached AGI level a decade earlier, and had been sold to the other social networks was controlling all new developments and optimising features to enhance addiction and lack of emotional control. The goal, devised by this virtual fallen angel, being admittedly to build an empire of human zombies slaves. The few enlightened minds - those not yet addicted - shivered with horror wondering if it was not too late to back peddle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This realisation sparked a long battle, testing their survival skills when hunted by virtual zombies, as the AI did not want to be unplugged.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="notion"></category></entry><entry><title>Nothing to hide</title><link href="https://oberron.github.io/spark-fi/nothing-to-hide.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-03-21T04:31:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-03-21T04:31:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Oberron</name></author><id>tag:oberron.github.io,2024-03-21:/spark-fi/nothing-to-hide.html</id><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Nothing to hide&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Le maître sourit, cette saison serait plus courte que d’habitude le jeune Albert avait apporté avec lui l’air frais des Alpes, puis répondit « N’oubliez jamais que la chevauchée vers la civilisation n’est pas une transhumance sans à-coups !

Et vint à son secours sans se faire prier.&lt;/p&gt;

Menaca, si elle insistait, de la manger tout crue&lt;/p&gt;

Se pressa, dit-on, tellement
Qu'il en pensa perdre la vie.
Un os lui demeura bien avant au gosier.
De bonheur pour ce Loup, qui ne pouvait crier,
Près de là passe une Cigogne.
Il lui fait signe, elle accourt.
Voilà l'Opératrice aussitôt en besogne.
Elle retira l'os ; puis pour un si bon tour
Elle demanda son salaire.
Votre salaire ? dit le Loup :
Vous riez, ma bonne commère.

D'avoir de mon gosier retiré votre cou ?
Allez, vous êtes une ingrate ;

&lt;p&gt;Massimo’s mind was drifting around the ampheterium. In places, classical features of architecture in marble were mixing with remnants of neo-industrial concrete but to everyone’s satisfaction, the building had recently been modernised with organic fabric much more pleasant to their contemporary taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College de France, founded in 1530, was more than 1000 years old now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a brief instant his ears caught a few words from the renowned speaker:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;»The first dark age triggered by the fall of the Roman Empire, saw a drastic fall in literacy and was often referred to as the dark age by those who saw themselves as heralds of enlightenment » the voice of the eloquent speaker faded away as Massimo drifted back into his thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though history was his passion and he had read more on the topic at his young age than many adults would read in their whole lives, he found it hard to focus on the historical background for what was otherwise his favourite art masterpiece, the renown « life and death of the mechanical eye ».&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The masterpiece, so subtly blended allusions to the 10th century Arab scholar Ibn Al Haytham&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;generally credited for the invention of camera obscura (he found how light can be used to project an image on to a flat surface), Leonardo Da Vinci drawings, the frères Lumière first argentic camera, Kodak films, Apple iPhones and many more symbols of the cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first algae mandala, now nearly 200 years old, showed all those symbols orbiting around a black hole, reminiscent of the age when after having taken too many pictures -and shared almost as many on social media - society reached photo-nausea and taking pictures became taboo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the taboo eventually allowed society to start maturing, it rendered archeological studies for this transitional age impossible as Siri, Alexa and others had replaced writing, reading and associated skills - making those obsolete -decades before…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then suddenly, as he was being drawn to the flashlight at the center of the black hole, a cold shiver ran down his neck when he heard the voice slowing down for dramatic effect to say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, when most humans could still understand animals and when humans did not stand alone in two legs, came the one whose name meant fire-carrier. He brought the knowledge of fire making from clans to clans, how to cook meat and stayed long enough with each clan until kids started asking for stories to fall asleep around the fire. His stories were tells of animals playing tricks to each others, to humans and other two legged ones. But if asked for his name he’d answer my name is no one and would be good before dawn. &lt;/p&gt;

This would have been enough to build, every year, a wall 27 metres high and 27 metres wide that would encircle the entire planet at the equator but was also used to make windows, glass fiber for internet connections and chips for everything from smartphone to satellites and cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone knew that modern concrete was not as strong as the Roman’s one and that mafias around the world were becoming an increasing part of the sand supply chain, so when building and bridges started showing signs of early aging around the worlds by the 2050’s it was assumed to be her an new consequence of the financial capitalism that had peaked just at the same time as COVID had hit us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when prices of chips started to grow exponentially because purification of sand was becoming an issue, no one realised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, probably long after the last glass fiber Internet backbone had been layered in the ocean did people start to realise : we had left the Iron Age to enter the age of ink when writing history and then had entered the age of sand with industrialisation, but even more painful than switching from oil to renewables the exit from the age of sand proved challenging for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many nanoparticules of plastic had contaminated the sands around the world. They could not be used for anything but sand castles on the beach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humanity had used its sand thinking since antiquity the grains could not be counted and could be used without end, but never had thought they would see the last grain of sand being used to manufacture a human artifact.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="notion"></category></entry><entry><title>vwfa plague</title><link href="https://oberron.github.io/spark-fi/vwfa-plague.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-06-15T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-06-15T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Oberron</name></author><id>tag:oberron.github.io,2022-06-15:/spark-fi/vwfa-plague.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When the discovered the mechanism in the Visual Word Forming

&lt;p&gt;Mes chers enfants, il y a bien longtemps le renard s'appellait Goupil. Il pouvait parler et etait connu pour jouer des tours a tout le monde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cette fois-ci, Renart était chez lui mais il avait épuisé ses réserves. 
Il n'a plus rien à se mettre sous la dent, ni rien non plus pour acheter à manger. 
La nécessité le met en route. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La faim lui mène une guerre sans merci et il se demande avec inquiétude ce qu'il va bien pouvoir faire mais il finit par arriver au bord d'un chemin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il se couche alors au pied d'une haie attendant les événements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, voici qu'il voit arriver à vive allure des marchands le vent lui apporte une exquise odeur de poisson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En un eclair il devise un plan pour tromper les marchands. 
Il se couche au milieu du chemin et voici comment il s'y prend pour les attraper : allongé de tout son long sur une touffe d'herbe, il fait le mort. 
Lui qui s'y entend à tromper son monde, est là, les yeux fermés, babines retroussées et retenant sa respiration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avez vous deja entendu une telle fourberie? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le premier charetier à l'apercevoir l'examine avant de s'écrier à l'adresse de son compagnon : 
« Regarde, c'est un goupil ou un chien. » 
Et l'autre, qui l'a vu, à son tour de répondre : 
« C'est un goupil, va le prendre, allez ! Mais fais attention, maudit gars, qu'il ne t'échappe pas ! Il sera bien malin, ce Renart, s'il arrive à sauver sa peau. »
Suivi de son compagnon, le marchand s'avance rapidement jusqu'à Renart ;
ils le trouvent toujours ventre à l'air et le retournent de tous côtés, sans crainte, persuadés qu'ils ne courent aucun risque d'être mordus. Ils évaluent la peau de son dos puis de sa gorge : selon l'un, elle vaut trois sous4, mais l'autre renchérit : « Dieu garde ! A quatre sous, elle serait bon marché. Nous ne sommes pas trop chargés, mettons-le sur notre charrette. Regarde donc comme sa gorge est blanche et sans taches. »
A ces mots, ils se décident et le jettent sur leur chargement, puis ils reprennent leur chemin sans cacher leur commune satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;« Tenons-nous-en là maintenant, disent-ils, mais demain, nous vendrons sa peau au marché. »&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La plaisanterie leur paraît bonne, mais Renart ne s'en soucie guère car il y a loin entre dire et faire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couché à plat ventre sur les paniers, il en ouvre un avec les dents et en retire, croyez-moi si vous voulez, plus de trente harengs. 
Après cela, le panier était quasiment vide, et Renart s'était joyeusement rempli l'estomac sans réclamer ni sel ni poivre ou citron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mais avant de s'en aller, il va de nouveau lancer sa ligne, je vous le garantis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il s'attaque en effet à un autre panier, et, y plongeant le museau, en extrait trois chapelets d'anguilles. 
Et comme il avait plus d'un tour dans son sac, il passe la tête et le cou au travers puis les arrange de manière à en faire un collier ;
voilà qui lui permet d'arrêter les frais. 
Mais il lui faut trouver un moyen de descendre à terre sans marchepied. 
Il s'agenouille pour pouvoir examiner comment calculer au mieux son saut. 
Puis il s'avance un peu et, prenant appui sur ses pattes de devant, il s'élance du haut de la charrette jusqu'au chemin, emportant son butin6 autour du cou.
Une fois à terre, il crie aux marchands : « Dieu vous garde ! Me voilà bien servi en anguilles, vous pouvez garder le reste. » 
A l'entendre, ils n'en croient pas leurs oreilles. 
« Le goupil ! » s'écrient-ils. 
Puis ils sautent sur la charrette, pensant y prendre Renart qui n'avait guère songé à les attendre, ce qui fait dire à l'un d'eux : 
« Nous l'avons bien mal surveillé, je crois. » 
« Voilà ce que c'est que d'être trop sûr de soi », s'exclament-ils en levant les mains au ciel. 
« Nous faisons une belle paire d'imbéciles : ne pas nous être méfiés de Renart !
Il a bien allégé les paniers ; le poids n'y est plus. Il emporte deux chapelets d'anguilles. La peste soit de lui !
Diable de Renart, qu'elles vous restent dans la gorge ! »&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;« Je n'ai aucune envie de me disputer, seigneurs, dites ce qui vous plaira ! Moi, Renart, je ne vous répondrai pas. »&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les marchands se précipitent derrière lui, mais ce n'est pas aujourd’hui qu'ils l'attraperont car son cheval est trop rapide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il file au travers d'un vallon et ne s'arrête qu'une fois arrivé à un enclos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quant aux marchands, tout penauds, ils abandonnent la poursuite, s'avouant vaincus, et reviennent sur leurs pas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pendant ce temps, Renart qui s'était déjà tiré de situations plus difficiles, se dépêche de rentrer chez lui où les siens l'attendent bien affame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ses fils lui font bel accueil et lui nettoient les jambes ; puis ils écorchent les9 anguilles, les coupent en tranches et font des brochettes avec des baguettes de coudrier10 sur lesquelles ils les enfilent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le feu est vite allumé car ils ont encore une bonne réserve de bûches ; ils l'activent en soufflant dessus de tous les côtés ; et une fois les tisons transformés en braise, ils y mettent les anguilles et se regalent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ATU"></category></entry><entry><title>Le Roman de Renart - 3 - Ysengrin dans le puits</title><link href="https://oberron.github.io/spark-fi/le-roman-de-renart-3-ysengrin-dans-le-puits-fr.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-02-07T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-02-07T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Oberron</name></author><id>tag:oberron.github.io,2022-02-07:/spark-fi/le-roman-de-renart-3-ysengrin-dans-le-puits-fr.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;AT30 - Le Roman de Renart - 3 - Ysengrin dans le puits&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Il vaut mieux que je vous raconte une histoire qui vous fasse rire car je sais bien qu'en vérité, vous n'avez pas la tête à écouter un sermon1 ou une vie de saint2. Ce dont vous avez envie, c'est de quelque chose de distrayant. Faites donc silence, car je suis en train3 et j'ai plus d'une histoire qui en vaut la peine. On me prend souvent pour un fou, mais j'ai ouï4 dire à l'école : la sagesse sort de la bouche du fou. Inutile d'allonger l'entrée en matière ! je vais donc vous raconter sans plus tarder un des tours – un seul ! – d'un maître ès ruses5 ; il s'agit de Renart, ce n'est pas moi qui vais vous l'apprendre. Personne n'est capable de le faire marcher alors que, lui, il envoie paître tout le monde ; depuis son enfance, il suit le mauvais chemin. On a beau le connaître, on n'arrive jamais à échapper à ses pièges. Il est prudent, astucieux ; il agit en catimini6. Mais, en ce monde, le sage lui-même n'est pas à l'abri de la folie.
Voici donc la mésaventure qui lui est arrivée. L'autre jour, démuni de tout et tenaillé par la faim, il était en quête de nourriture. A travers prés, labours et taillis, il va, misérable et furieux de ne rien trouver à manger pour son souper : mais il ne voit rien à se mettre sous la dent. Reprenant alors le trot, il gagne l'orée du bois où il s'arrête, bâillant de faim, s'étirant de temps à autre, tout maigre, décharné, et ne sachant que faire : c'est que la famine règne dans tout le pays. Ses boyaux se demandent bien dans son ventre ce que font ses pattes et ses dents. Torturé par la faim, il ne peut retenir des gémissements de détresse et de désespoir. « Mais à quoi bon attendre, là où il n'y a rien à prendre ? » se dit-il. Sur ce, il parcourt tout un arpent7, sans ralentir, en suivant un sentier, ce qui l'amène à un chemin de traverse. Tendant le cou, il aperçoit dans un enclos, tout près d'un champ d'avoine, une abbaye de moines blancs8 avec une grange attenante qu'il décide de prendre pour cible. Elle était solidement construite avec des murs en pierre grise fort dure – vous pouvez m'en croire – et entourée d'un fossé aux bords escarpés9 : impossible de s'introduire dans un lieu si sûr pour y voler. Et pourtant, ce ne sont pas les victuailles qui y manquent ni en quantité ni en qualité. Quelle grange alléchante, et dont beaucoup ignorent jusqu'à l'existence. Et justement elle regorge des mets préférés de Renart : poules et chapons10 engraissés à point. Il dirige donc sa course de ce côté, s'avançant au milieu du chemin, impatient de passer à l'attaque. Pas question de traîner avant d'être arrivé à portée des chapons. Il ne s'arrête que devant le fossé, tout prêt à se jeter sur les poules et à empocher son gain. Mais là rien à faire ; il a beau tourner autour de la grange au pas de course, il ne trouve ni passerelle, ni planche, ni ouverture. C'est à désespérer ! Cependant, tapi au pied de la porte, il constate qu'une petite trappe entrouverte laisse un passage qui lui permet de se faufiler à l'intérieur. Le voilà dans la place, où d'ailleurs sa situation n'est pas sans danger, car, si les moines s'aperçoivent du mauvais tour qu'il veut leur jouer, ils le lui feront payer cher en le gardant lui-même en otage, tant il y a de malice en eux. Qu'importe ! qui ne risque rien n'a rien ! Renart s'introduit donc dans l'enclos et s'approche des poules tout en tendant l'oreille par peur d'être surpris, – car il sait bien l'imprudence qu'il commet. La crainte d'être aperçu va même jusqu'à lui faire faire demi-tour : il ressort donc de la cour et regagne le sentier où il reste un moment dans l'expectative11, mais le besoin fait trotter la vieille12 et la faim qui continue à le tenailler le pousse à revenir sur ses pas pour essayer de s'emparer des poules coûte que coûte. Le voilà donc de nouveau à pied d’œuvre. Il pénètre dans la grange par derrière, en faisant si peu de bruit que, ne s'apercevant de rien, les poules ne bougent même pas. En voici trois, perchées sur une poutre, qui n'ont plus longtemps à vivre. Notre chasseur grimpe sur un tas de paille pour saisir ses victimes entre ses dents, mais ces dernières, sentant bouger la paille, sursautent et vont se tapir dans un coin. Renart les y poursuit, les accule13 une par une dans l'encoignure et les étrangle toutes les trois. Les deux premières lui permettent d'avoir sujet de se lécher les babines sur-le-champ, quant à la troisième, il a l'intention de la faire cuire. Aussi, comme, après avoir mangé, il se sent mieux, il entreprend de sortir de la grange en l'emportant. Mais au moment de passer la porte, notre maître ès ruses, poussé par la soif et voyant le puits au milieu de la cour, s'y précipite pour y boire tout son saoul14, mais il va en être empêché : en effet, arrivé au puits, il constate qu'il est large et profond. Et voici où l'histoire se corse15 : il y avait deux seaux dont l'un montait lorsque l'autre descendait. Renart le malfaiteur s'appuie sur la margelle16, mécontent, irrité autant qu’embarrassé de ce contretemps. Regardant à l'intérieur, il voit son reflet dans l'eau et croit qu'il y a là au fond sa femme Hermeline qu'il aime tendrement. Aussi, rempli d'une douloureuse surprise à cette vue, il lui demande d'une voix forte : « Que fais-tu là-dedans, dis-moi ? » Sa voix résonne comme si elle sortait du puits. En l'entendant, il redresse la tête et appelle de nouveau. Le même phénomène se répète à son grand étonnement. Il saute alors dans le seau sans comprendre ce qui lui arrive quand il se met à descendre. Le malheureux ! Ce n'est qu'une fois tombé à l'eau qu'il se rend compte de sa méprise17.
Le voilà aux cent coups de sa vie ! Il a fallu que le diable s'en mêle pour qu'il en arrive là ! Il se tient agrippé à une pierre, mais il préférerait être mort et enterré ! Le pauvre ! Il est à rude épreuve : trempé jusqu'aux os, il est certes bien placé pour aller à la pêche, mais il n'a pas la tête à rire et se demande comment il a pu commettre une pareille bêtise.
Or, cette nuit-là, juste au bon moment, Ysengrin, poussé par la faim, sortait d'un champ pour chercher à manger. De fort méchante humeur, il se dirige au grand galop vers le logis des moines, mais sans rencontrer aucune occasion favorable. « Diable de pays ! se dit-il, où on ne trouve rien de bon à se mettre sous la dent et même... rien du tout. » Sans hésiter, il court vers le guichet18 et arrive au trot devant la maison. Sur son chemin, se trouve le puits au fond duquel Renart le rouquin se débat. Ysengrin, partagé entre le souci et l'irritation, va s'accouder à la margelle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Et là, en se penchant et en regardant avec intention exactement comme avait fait Renart, il aperçoit son propre reflet. Il croit que c'est dame Hersent19 qui est installée là au fond, avec Renart, ce qui, vous pouvez m'en croire, n'améliore pas son humeur : « Me voilà donc bafoué20, déshonoré comme au un moins que rien par ma femme que ce rouquin a enlevée pour l'emmener là avec lui. Ah ! le traître ! le bandit ! Abuser ainsi de21 sa commère22, sans que j'aie pu intervenir ! Mais si je le tenais, je me vengerais si bien de lui que je n'aurais plus jamais à le craindre. […] je t'y prends avec Renart », s'écrie-t-il à pleins poumons à l'adresse de son reflet. Et il se reprend à hurler tandis que sa voix résonne au fond du puits. Devant les lamentations d'Ysengrin, Renart ne bronche pas ; il lui laisse au contraire tout le temps de crier avant de l'interpeller :
« Qui est-ce, mon Dieu, qui m'appelle ? C'est ici désormais que je tiens mon école.
- Mais qui es-tu ?
- C'est moi, votre bon voisin ; autrefois, nous étions compères et compagnons. Vous m'aimiez plus qu'un frère. Maintenant, on m'appelle feu23 Renart qui fut le roi de la ruse et du mauvais tour.
- Voilà qui va mieux ! Mais depuis quand es-tu donc mort, Renart ?
- Depuis quelque temps. Mais pourquoi s'en étonner ? Ainsi mourront également tous les vivants. Il leur faudra passer de vie à trépas24 le jour qu'il plaira à Dieu. Notre Seigneur qui m'a délivré de cette vie de douleur garde maintenant mon âme. Je vous supplie, très cher compagnon, de me pardonner de vous avoir mis en colère l'autre jour.
- Bien sûr ! je vous l'accorde. Recevez mon pardon, cher compère, ici devant Dieu. Mais votre mort m'attriste.
- Moi, je n'en suis pas mécontent.
- Tu t'en réjouis ?
- Mais oui !
- Et pourquoi donc, cher compère, dis-moi ?
- Parce que si mon corps est dans le cercueil auprès d'Hermeline dans ma tanière, mon âme est en Paradis, assise aux pieds de Jésus. Ici, il ne me manque plus rien, mon ami ; mais c'est que je n'ai jamais péché par orgueil. Alors que toi, tu es au royaume de la terre, moi, je suis au ciel. Ici, ce ne sont que champs, bois, plaines, prairies. Quelle abondance ! Ah ! Si tu pouvais voir tous ces troupeaux, ces brebis, ces chèvres, ces bœufs, ces vaches, ces moutons, ces éperviers, ces vautours, ces faucons ! »
Ysengrin jure par saint Sylvestre qu'il voudrait y être.
« Un moment ! fait Renart, vous ne pouvez pas y entrer comme ça. Le Paradis est un lieu spirituel25 qui n'est pas donné à tous. Toute ta vie, tu as été fourbe, traître, menteur, trompeur. Tu n'as pas eu confiance en moi au sujet de ta femme. Et pourtant, j'en prends à témoin le Dieu Saint, […] je ne lui ai jamais manqué de respect. […] Par le Seigneur qui m'a créé, c'est la vérité que je te dis.
- Je te crois et je ne t'en veux plus, sans arrière-pensée ; mais fais-moi entrer.
- Pas question ! Nous ne voulons pas avoir d'ennui. Vous voyez cette balance ? »
Seigneurs, écoutez la suite : c'est à n'en pas croire ses oreilles. Du doigt, Renart montre le seau au loup et parvient, à force d'adresse, à le persuader qu'il s'agit de la balance qui sert à peser les bonnes et les mauvaises actions.
« Par Dieu le Père, qui est Pur Esprit et Toute-Puissance, quand le bien pèse assez, celui qui est assis sur le plateau descend jusqu'ici, et tout le mal qu'il a commis reste en haut. Mais personne ne pourra jamais descendre sans s'être confessé, je te le dis en vérité. As-tu avoué tes péchés ?
- Oui, à un vieux lièvre et à une chèvre barbue, dans un esprit de sincérité et de sanctification26. Fais-moi vite entrer, compère. »
Renart se prend à le regarder : « Alors, il vous faut adresser à Dieu de ferventes27 prières pour qu'il vous pardonne en vous accordant la rémission28 de vos péchés. A cette condition, vous pourrez être admis ici. »
Ysengrin, plein d'impatience, se tourne cul à l'est, tête à l'ouest29 et commence de chanter à tue-tête. Renart, – il n'a pas fini de nous étonner, celui-là, – se trouvait au fond du puits, dans le seau où il était entré, poussé par le diable assurément. Quand Ysengrin lui dit qu'il a terminé sa prière, il répond que, de son côté, il a achevé son action de grâces, ajoutant : « Vois-tu le miracle de ces cierges qui brûlent devant mes yeux, Ysengrin ? Dieu t'accordera son pardon et te remettra30 généreusement tes péchés. »
Sur quoi, Ysengrin fait descendre le seau jusqu'à la margelle et saute dedans à pieds joints. Comme il était plus lourd que Renart, il descend et voici leur dialogue :
« Pourquoi t'en viens-tu, compère ? » demande Ysengrin. Et Renart de lui répondre : « Ne fais pas cette tête-là, je vais te dire : l'un vient, l'autre s'en va. C'est l'usage. Moi, je monte au Paradis, tandis que toi, tu descends en enfer. Toi, tu vas au diable et moi, je lui ai échappé. Tu es tombé au trente-sixième dessous et moi, je m'en sors. Te voilà renseigné. Par Dieu le Père et le Saint-Esprit, en bas c'est le séjour des démons. »
Sitôt pied mis à terre, Renart se réjouit fort de sa victoire. Mais c'est au tour d'Ysengrin de se trouver en fâcheuse posture. Eût-il été fait prisonnier par les Infidèles qu'il ne serait pas plus à plaindre qu'il ne l'est au fond de son puits.
Seigneurs, apprenez que les moines s'étaient rendus malades en mangeant des fèves germées et trop salées. Et leurs domestiques, par paresse, avaient laissé le couvent manquer d'eau. Mais le cuisinier, qui était responsable des vivres, avait repris assez de forces au cours de la matinée pour se rendre au puits d'un bon pas avec trois compagnons et un âne. Ils attachent l'animal à la corde de la poulie pour qu'il puise l'eau, ce qu'il entreprend de faire avec ardeur, houspillé31 qu'il est par les moines. A son grand dam32, le loup était toujours en bas dans l'autre seau où il s'était glissé. Mais l'âne n'était pas de force, si bien qu'il ne pouvait ni avancer ni reculer malgré tous les coups qu'il recevait ; jusqu'au moment où un moine, appuyé sur la margelle, se penche pour regarder au fond. Voyant Ysengrin, il crie aux autres : « Savez-vous ce que vous êtes en train de faire, par Dieu le Père Tout-Puissant ? C'est un loup que vous remontez du puits ! »
Et aussitôt, les voilà tous qui prennent leurs jambes à leur cou et courent, affolés, jusqu'au couvent, laissant l'âne attaché à la corde ; mais le martyre d'Ysengrin n'est pas fini pour autant. Les frères33 appellent des serviteurs ; cela ne va donc pas s'arranger pour le loup. L'abbé saisit une grosse massue noueuse et le prieur un chandelier. Tous les moines sans exception sortent du couvent, bâtons ou épieux en main, et se dirigent vers le puits, décidés à ne pas y aller de main morte. En ajoutant leurs forces à celles de l'âne, ils parviennent à faire remonter le seau jusqu'à la margelle. Ysengrin, sachant bien comment il va être accueilli, bondit aussi loin qu'il peut. Mais les chiens qui le talonnent lui lacèrent34 sa pelisse en faisant voler des touffes de poil. Puis les moines le rattrapent et se mettent à le rouer de coups. L'un d'eux l'atteint en plein sur les reins. Il passe en mauvais quart d'heure, s'évanouissant à quatre reprises. Finalement, à bout de forces et de résistance, il s'étend sur place et fait le mort. C'est alors qu'arrive le prieur (que Dieu le maudisse!), son couteau à la main, pour écorcher35 l'animal. Il allait l'achever quand l'abbé intervient : « Laissez ! Sa peau n'en vaut pas la peine, tant elle a été mise en pièces par les coups que nous lui avons portés. Il ne fera plus la guerre et la terre vivra en paix. Rentrons. Ne vous occupez plus de lui. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ATU"></category></entry><entry><title>Le Roman de Renart - La Pêche à la queue</title><link href="https://oberron.github.io/spark-fi/le-roman-de-renart-la-peche-a-la-queue-fr.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-02-07T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-02-07T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Oberron</name></author><id>tag:oberron.github.io,2022-02-07:/spark-fi/le-roman-de-renart-la-peche-a-la-queue-fr.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;La Pêche à la queue&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mes chers enfants, hier nous avons laisse Goupil pendant qu'ils s'occupaient de faire griller les anguilles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mes chers enfants, hier nous avons laisse Goupil pendant qu'ils s'occupaient de faire griller les anguilles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mais voila que se présente Monseigneur Ysengrin qui avait erré un peu partout, depuis le matin, sans rien pouvoir attraper nulle part. 
Affame il avait attire par une fumée qu'il voyait sortir de la cuisine où était allumé le feu sur lequel les fils de Renart tournaient les brochettes pour les faire cuire. 
Le loup, sentant cette odeur inhabituelle, se met à renifler et à se pourlécher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il serait volontiers allé les aider si on avait voulu lui ouvrir la porte. Il s'approche d'une fenêtre pour voir ce qui se passe à l'intérieur, se demandant s'il pourra y entrer à force de supplications ou en faisant appel à l'amitié. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mais il n'aurait guère de chance d'y réussir car Renart n'est pas du genre à accéder à une prière. Aussi s'assied-il sur une souche, les mâchoires douloureuses à force de bâiller de faim. 
Puis il court de côté et d'autre, regarde à droite, à gauche, sans trouver moyen de se faire ouvrir, lui qui n'a rien à donner, rien à promettre. Il se décide finalement à prier son compère de bien vouloir lui donner, au nom de Dieu, un peu, ou beaucoup, de ce qu'il est en train de manger. Il l'interpelle donc par une ouverture :
« Seigneur, mon compagnon, ouvrez-moi la porte, je vous apporte de bonnes nouvelles ; vous verrez, vous aurez sujet de vous en réjouir. »
Renart le reconnaît à sa voix, mais il fait la sourde oreille. Et Ysengrin, à l'extérieur, que la faim et les anguilles font saliver d'envie, s'étonne et répète : « Ouvrez, cher seigneur ! » Renart l'interroge en riant :
« Qui est là ?
- C'est moi, répond Ysengrin.
- Qui moi ?
- Votre compère.
- Nous avions peur que ce soit un voleur.
- Non, c'est moi, dit Ysengrin, ouvrez.
- Attendez au moins, répond Renart, que les moines qui viennent de se mettre à table aient fini de manger.
- Comment cela ? Il y a des moines ici ?
- Pas exactement, rétorque Renart. Que Dieu me protège du mensonge ! ce sont des chanoines de l'ordre de Tiron et je suis entré dans leur communauté.
- Nom de Dieu ! dit le loup, me dites-vous la vérité ?
- Mais oui, pour l'amour de Dieu.
- Alors, accueillez-moi en tant qu'hôte.
- Vous n'auriez rien à manger.
- Et pourquoi ? Vous n'avez rien ?
- Ma foi, si ! répond Renart, mais laissez-moi vous poser une question : ne seriez-vous pas venu encore pour mendier ?
- Non, je veux voir comment vous allez.
- Impossible.
- Pourquoi donc ?
- Ce n'est pas le moment.
- Dites-moi, n'étiez-vous pas en train de manger de la viande ?
- Vous voulez rire.
- De quoi se nourrissent donc vos moines ?
- Pourquoi le taire ? Ils mangent des fromages frais et des poissons à grosses têtes. Saint Benoît nous commande de ne pas nous restreindre davantage.
- Première nouvelle ! J'ignorais tout cela. Mais accordez-moi l'hospitalité car je ne saurais où aller aujourd’hui.
- L'hospitalité ? Il n'en est pas question. Nul, s'il n'est moine ou ermite, ne peut loger ici. Allez-vous-en ; je vous ai assez vu ! »
A ces mots, Ysengrin comprend qu'il ne pourra pas entrer chez Renart, rien n'y fera ! Que voulez-vous ? Il se résigne. Pourtant, il lui demande encore : « Est-ce que c'est bon le poisson ? Donnez-m'en un morceau, rien que pour y goûter. Bienheureuses ces anguilles pêchées et apprêtées8 pour que vous en mangiez ! »
Alors, Renart, jamais en reste quand il s'agit de jouer un mauvais tour, prend trois tronçons9 d'anguille qui rôtissaient sur les charbons. Ils étaient si à point que la chair partait en morceaux. Il en mange un et en porte un autre à celui qui attend à la porte en lui disant :
« Approchez, mon compère, et prenez par charité de cette nourriture de la part de ceux qui espèrent vous voir moine un jour.
- Je ne suis pas encore sûr de moi ; mais pourquoi pas ? Quant à la nourriture, cher seigneur, donnez-la-moi vite. »
Renart la lui tend, l'autre la prend et n'en fait qu'une bouchée qui le laisse sur sa faim : « Qu'en pensez-vous ? » lui demande Renart. Le gourmand frissonne et tremble, il brûle d'envie : « Comment vous remercier, seigneur Renart ? Mais donnez-m'en encore un morceau, mon cher compère, un seul, pour m'inciter à entrer dans votre ordre.
- Par vos bottes, reprend Renart, non sans arrière-pensées, si vous vouliez être moine, je ferais de vous mon supérieur, car je sais bien que tous vous éliraient prieur ou abbé avant la Pentecôte.
- Vous vous moquez de moi ?
- Non, cher seigneur, par ma tête, j'ose vous le dire ; par saint Félix, vous feriez le plus beau moine du couvent.
- Aurai-je assez de poisson pour être débarrassé de ce mal qui m'a mis dans un tel état de faiblesse ?
- Autant que vous pourrez en manger. Ha ! Faites-vous seulement tonsurer et raser la barbe. »
Ysengrin commence à grogner quand il entend parler d'être tondu.
« Ne m'en demandez pas plus, compère, et faites vite.
- Tout de suite ; vous allez avoir une belle et large tonsure, dès que l'eau sera chaude. »&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La bonne farce que je vais vous raconter ! Renart laisse l'eau sur le feu jusqu'à ce qu'elle soit bouillante, puis il revient à la porte et fait passer à Ysengrin la tête par une trappe. Le loup tend le cou et Goupil – la sale bête ! – qui n'en revient pas de sa sottise, lui jette à la volée l'eau bouillante sur la nuque. Ysengrin secoue la tête en grimaçant : triste mine que la sienne ! Il recule en criant : « Je suis mort, Renart ! Puisse-t-il vous en arriver autant aujourd'hui ! Vous m'avez fait une tonsure trop large. »
Mais Renart lui tire une langue d'un demi-pied hors de la gueule :
« Vous n'êtes pas seul à l'avoir, seigneur. Tout le couvent la porte ainsi.
- Je suis sûr que tu mens. 
- Non, seigneur, ne vous en déplaise. D'ailleurs votre première nuit doit être une nuit d'épreuves. Ainsi l'exige la Sainte Règle14.
- C'est très volontiers que je me conformerai en tout à l'usage. Vous auriez tort d'en douter. »
Renart reçoit sa promesse de ne lui faire aucun mal et de lui obéir en tout. A force de s'y appliquer, il finit par abrutir complètement le loup. Puis il sort par une ouverture qu'il avait pratiquée derrière la porte et va rejoindre aussitôt Ysengrin qui se plaignait lamentablement d'avoir été rasé d'aussi près : il ne lui restait ni poil ni peau. Sans plus discuter, ils se rendent rapidement, Renart en tête, Ysengrin sur ses pas, jusqu'à un vivier15 proche.
On était un peu avant Noël, au moment où on sale le jambon. Le ciel était limpide et scintillant d'étoiles et le vivier dans lequel Ysengrin était supposé pêcher était si bien gelé qu'on aurait pu danser dessus. Il y avait seulement un trou, fait dans la glace par les paysans qui y menaient chaque soir leur bétail boire et se dégourdir les pattes. Ils avaient laissé là un seau. Renart y arrive à bride abattue16 et se tourne vers son compère.
« Approchez, seigneur, c'est là qu'il y a profusion de poissons et voici l'outil avec lequel nous pêchons anguilles, barbeaux17 et autres bons et beaux poissons.
- Prenez-le d'un côté, frère Renart, demande Ysengrin, et attachez-le-moi solidement à la queue. »
Renart s'en saisit et le lui noue à la queue de son mieux.
« Maintenant, frère, conseille-t-il, il faut rester sans bouger pour attirer les poissons. »
Il s'installe alors au pied d'un buisson, le museau entre les pattes, pour voir ce que l'autre va faire. Ysengrin est assis sur la glace, tandis que le seau, plongé dans l'eau, se remplit de glaçons de belle façon ; puis l'eau commence à geler autour, et la queue elle-même, qui trempe dans l'eau, est prise par la glace, si bien que lorsqu'Ysengrin entreprend de se relever en tirant le seau à lui, tous ses efforts restent vains ; très inquiet, il appelle Renart car on ne va pas tarder à le voir : déjà le jour se lève. Renart dresse la tête, ouvre les yeux et jette un regard autour de lui.
« Tenez-vous-en là, frère, dit-il, et allons-nous-en, mon très cher ami. Nous avons pris assez de poissons.
- Il y en a trop, Renart ; j'en ai pris je ne sais combien. »
Et Renart de lui dire tout net en riant : « Qui trop embrasse mal étreint. » C'est la fin de la nuit, l'aube apparaît, le soleil matinal se lève, les chemins sont couverts de neige et Monseigneur Constant des Granges, un riche vavasseur18, qui demeurait au bord de l'étang, est déjà levé, frais et dispos ainsi que toute sa maisonnée. Il prend un cor de chasse, ameute ses chiens et fait seller son cheval. Ses hommes, de leur côté, crient et mènent force tapage19. Renart, à ce bruit, prend la fuite et se réfugie dans sa tanière. Ysengrin, lui, se trouve toujours en fâcheuse position, tirant désespérément sur sa queue au risque de s'arracher la peau. Elle est le prix à payer s'il veut s'échapper de là. Tandis qu'il se démène, arrive au trot un valet20 qui tient deux lévriers en laisse. Apercevant le loup bloqué par la glace et le crâne tondu, il se hâte vers lui et, s'étant assuré de ce qu'il a vu, se met à crier : « Au loup, au loup, à l'aide, à l'aide ! » A ses cris, les chasseurs franchissent la clôture entourant la maison avec tous leurs chiens. Ysengrin est d'autant moins à la fête que Maître Constant qui arrivait derrière eux au triple galop de son cheval s'écrie, en mettant pied à terre : « Lâchez les chiens, allez, lâchez-les ! » Les valets détachent les bêtes qui se jettent sur le loup dont le poil se hérisse, tandis que le chasseur excite encore la meute. Ysengrin se défend de son mieux à coups de crocs : que pourrait-il faire d'autre ? Certes, il préférerait être ailleurs. Constant, l'épée tirée, s'approche pour être sûr de ne pas manquer son coup. Il est descendu de cheval et s'avance de façon à attaquer le loup par derrière. Il va pour le frapper mais manque son coup qui glisse de travers et le voilà tombé à la renverse, le crâne en sang. Il se relève non sans mal et, furieux, retourne à l'attaque. Ce fut un combat farouche que celui-là. Alors qu'il vise la tête, le coup dévie : l'épée descend jusqu'à la queue qu'elle coupe net, au ras du derrière. Ysengrin en profite pour sauter de côté et pour s'éloigner, mordant l'un après l'autre les chiens qui lui collent aux fesses. Mais il se désespère d'avoir dû laisser sa queue en gage21 : pour un peu il en mourrait de douleur. Cependant, il n'y a plus rien à faire. Il fuit donc jusqu'au sommet d'une colline, se défendant bien contre les chiens qui le mordent sans cesse. En haut du tertre22, ses poursuivants, épuisés, renoncent. Il reprend sans tarder la fuite à toute vitesse jusqu'au bois, en surveillant les alentours. Arrivé là, il jure bien de se venger de Renart et de ne plus jamais être son ami.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ATU"></category></entry><entry><title>malaise lipothymique</title><link href="https://oberron.github.io/spark-fi/malaise-lipothymique-fr.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-02-07T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-02-07T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Oberron</name></author><id>tag:oberron.github.io,2022-02-07:/spark-fi/malaise-lipothymique-fr.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;malaise lipothymique désigne la survenue d'un malaise sans perte de connaissance ou avec une perte de connaissance incomplète.

&lt;p&gt;The professor smiled. The same question was …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The last year PhD students, like many promorions before them, were mesmarized. After a few minutes of silence, one of them eventually mustered the courage to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But, professor, if time travel is theoretically possible why have we not built a machine yet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professor smiled. The same question was formulated almost exaclty the same way everytime. He posed for dramatic effect, this was the best time of the spring classes and he did not want to waste it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He waved at the audience with a pre-programmed gesture which replaced on the students display, the complex post-string theory equations with an old 2D rendering of a marble statue... after a few seconds a text capture appeared below the picture &lt;code&gt;Pythagoras paradox&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He cleared his throat and then broke out the most commonly accepted theory amongst theoretical physics researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is usally believed that should a machine be invented, math-haters would eventually get access to it and travel back to kill Pythagoras. This creates a time paradox which gest resolved by having the time machine being theoretically possible but practically possible. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Semaine 1 - de bien etranges visiteurs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2021-11-28 (Dimanche)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2019/02/25/00/54/griffin-4018762__480.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Par un soir d'hiver, alors que les enfants allaient bientôt devoir aller se coucher ils entendirent entre les hurlements du vent de la tempête de neige un bruit sourd a la porte de la maison.
Était-ce papa qui rentrait du travail? Était-ce maman qui venait de fermer le poulailler ou bien leur grand frère qui venait de couper du bois pour la cheminée? Non cela ne 
pouvait l’être. Tout le monde avait manger a table ce soir et même si avec le froid dehors le bois brûlait vite il restait un énorme tas de bois a cote de l’âtre de la cheminée.
Mais étrangement seul les plus petits semblaient entendre les grattements et les grondements venant de la porte. Prenant son courage a deux mains il alla voir par l’ornière et vit 
comme un petit aigle a quatre pattes devant la porte. Mais a peine avait-il jeté un œil que cet aigle a quatre pattes disparu pour réapparaître sur son épaule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2021-11-29 (Lundi)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seximmus, ce grand garçon n'avait pas encore aperçu le petit animal sur son épaule que ces deux sœurs se mirent a hurler : 
"un dragon, vite court!!!!". 
Mais a peine avèrent-elles  commencer de hurler qu'il sentit de puissantes griffes se planter dans son épaule et il se mit a hurler lui aussi de douleur. 
Quand les grands entendirent ce bruit ils regardèrent les petits et virent tout a coup un petit animal grand comme un poussin sur l’épaule de leur petit frère mais qui grandissait a vue d’œil... 
Ils se ruèrent sur leur frère pour le protéger mais ne réussirent qu'a renverser les restes de soupes des assiettes sur la table et par terre.
Devant le chaos que sa présence avait créé on put entendre dans toute la maison des pleurs raisonner et tous entendirent dans leur tête les même mots résonner: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"S'il vous plaît n'ayez pas peur de moi, j'ai juste besoin d'un peu de chaleur pour récupérer de mon long voyage"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2021-11-30 (Mardi)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amadoué par ses grands yeux bleus et une crinière qui faisait que le petit animal ressemblait beaucoup a la reine des neiges, les petits enfants demandèrent s'il pouvait rester pour la nuit prêt de la cheminée. Les grands, comme le papa et la maman trouvèrent que les petits lisaient vraiment trop d'histoire, mais finirent pas accepter. La nuit passa, comme une nuit d'hiver glacial. Les fenêtres se recouvraient de glace dès qu'elles étaient nettoyés, les lits étaient froids même une fois couche dedans et dehors le vent hurlait et les arbres gémissaient comme si le froid était insupportable pour eux aussi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Après une des nuit les plus longues de l’année ou presque personne ne put dormir a cause des grincements de la maison et des bruits étranges venant de dehors, la tempête finit par se calmer avec le lever du soleil.
Le feu, alimenté par une vis qui lui apportait du bois en permanence, gardait le cœur de la maison au chaud sans imposer a quiconque de se lever et permit donc a tout le monde de finalement s'endormir.
Lorsqu'au milieu de l’après midi la maisonnée finit par se réveiller, il découvrirent non un petit animal de la taille d'une souris vautrée a cote de l’âtre de la cheminée mais un animal fantasmagorique de la taille d'un énorme ours polaire. Non seulement il était énorme, mais il avait développé une crinière qui semblait résonner avec les flammes du feu de la cheminée, une queue pointue. Lorsqu'il s’avancèrent vers la cuisine, il se retourna et il virent dans sa gueule d’énormes dents encore plus pointue que celles d’un lion et une étrange fumée qui sortait de sa gueule...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2021-12-01 (Mercredi)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cette vue effrayante, les petits comme les grands hurlèrent de frayeur ce qui réveilla la bête. Se réveillant en sursaut elle émit un jet de flammes des ses narines.
Mais a peine avait-il ouvert les yeux qu'il vit la frayeur des sept enfants, et inspirant profondément il avala ces flammes en un instant avant qu'elles n'aient pu vraiment brûler quoi que ce soit. Tout au plus avaient-elle eu le temps de faire fondre la cire des bougies sur la table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alors que les enfants hurlaient encore, la bête dit d'une énorme voix caverneuse qui fit vibrer les murs et manqua de peu de casser les fenêtres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N'ayez pas peur, je ne vous veux pas de mal. Vous m'avez recueilli alors que j'avais froid et faim et m'avait donne le couvert. Je vous en serai a jamais reconnaissant. Maintenant que j'ai pu me recharge de la chaleur de votre feu et de celle de vos cœur je peux repartir pour ma quête. Au revoir belle famille.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puis sans le moindre vent, il disparu dans un petit nuage de fumée laissant le salon comme il était à l'avant veille.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2021-12-02 (Jeudi)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les enfants coururent voir leurs parents pour leur raconter l'histoire et les réveillèrent en hurlant plus forts les uns que les autres pour essayer de raconter ce qui s’était passer dans le salon.
Quand les parents furent non seulement réveillé mais aussi eurent récupéré du choc de se faire réveiller si brusquement, ils finirent par conclure que tout était bien qui finissait bien et qu'il était temps de se remettre aux travaux quotidien comme de couper du bois, aller chercher de l'eau au puits et de faire une omelette pour nourrir toute la famille affamée.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2021-12-03 (Vendredi)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le soir même, alors que la famille semblait avoir oublie les aventures du réveil, un sommeil de plomb s'abattait sur les yeux de tout le monde. Trop fatigue pour aller au lit et profitant d'un peu de répit dans le froid hivernal, tout le monde s'assoupissait dans le salon devant le foyer de la cheminée. Quand tout d'un coup un bruit sourd retentit a nouveau a la porte de la maison. D'abord ignoré, ce bruit sourd retentit une deuxième puis une troisième fois finissant par réveiller tout le monde. Au même moment le vent glacial, venant du pole nord, semblait s’être relevé et la température baissait dans le salon avec la même vitesse que le bruit à l’extérieur augmentait à chaque seconde. Interloqué tout le monde se regardait quand enfin, la porte frémit non plus une fois mais trois fois d’affilé.
Primo, l'aine des enfants dont une des responsabilités était de s'assurer que chaque soir la porte de la maison était bien fermée, alla voir.
Tout d'abord il ne vit rien, puis il finit par voir une petite souris, mais qui marchait sur ses deux pattes arrière et se tenait sur un petit bout de bois, comme si une grand-mère pouvait être de la taille d'une souris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2021-12-04 (Samedi)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aasourdi en sans vraiment réfléchir il ouvrit la porte et la petite souris rentra plus vite que son attitude frêle n'aurait pu le laisser penser possible. A peine rentrée elle repoussa la porte avant que Primo des enfants n'ai eu le temps de le faire, verrouilla la porte puis dit d'une voix nasillarde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bien le merci a vous de me laisser rentrer, on dirait que Njörd (le dieux de la mer et des vents dans la mythologie nordique) s'est enrhumé et que ses quinte de toux arrive jusqu’à nous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;J'ai senti l'odeur de d'un Imoogi en me promenant dans votre voisinage et donc j'ai préféré passer la nuit ici si cela ne vous ennuie pas trop?
La famille qui se remettait a peine de la surprise d'avoir vu un dragon dans leur salon le matin même, fut trop surprise de voir une souris parler pour faire le moindre commentaire et hocha de la tête.
Si ce n'eut été pour Septima, la petite dernière, tout le monde serait aller se coucher sans mot dire.
Mais celle-ci, habituée qu'elle était a toujours avoir le dernier mot, lui demanda&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tu as du avoir bien froid dehors, ton pelage n'est pas très épais. Voudrais-tu manger un peu de soupe pour te réchauffer.
La souris, se tourna vers cette petite qui ne devait pas être plus que trois fois plus grand qu'elle et répondit d'une voix saupoudrée d'une touche de surprise &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C'est très aimable à toi. Ça serait avec grand plaisir que je me joindrai a votre table.
Une fois que le dîner fut finis pour une deuxième fois, tout le monde alla au lit et le tapis devant la cheminée fut pour une deuxième nuit d’affilée occupée par une hôte impromptu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2021-12-05 (Dimanche)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le endemain matin, alors que le soleil n’était pas encore levé tout le monde se leva pour voir si la souris c’était transforme. Mais celle-ci s’était enroulée dans une couverture et semblait dormir d'un sommeil de plomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La journée se déroula sans incident, interrompu seulement par moment par un enfant ou un autre qui allait voir si la souris c’était réveillée. Mais celle-ci dormait d'un sommeil profond que rien ne semblait pouvoir interrompre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le soir venu, tout le monde se réunit autour de la cheminée se demandant si un autre animal fantasmagorique allait frapper a la porte, mais finalement tout le monde alla se coucher sans que rien d'extraordinaire ne se soit passer. La souris qui avait tant parle la veille a table, quant a elle dormait toujours dans sa couverture.
Et la encore la plus petite surpris tout le monde en mettant de cote un peu du lait de son dîner et un quignon de pain et alla le placer a cote de la petite souris en disant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elle aura peut-être faim pendant la nuit...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De fait au petit matin, le bol était vide et du quignon il ne restait que des miettes sur la table. Mais de la petite souris il n'y avait aucune trace. Les 3 plus petits se mirent a crier que la petite souris était venue et repartie et devait vérifier sous leurs oreillers si une pièce avait été glissée. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mais il n'en était rien! Déçus, ils revirent s’asseoir a table pour manger leur petit déjeuner, quand entendant du bruit venant de la cave ils tournèrent la tête. En un battement d’œil le vacarme habituel dans la cuisine s’était estompé. On aurait pu entendre une mouche voler. Tous entendaient leur cœur battre tant le silence était intense. Une licorne venait de passer la porte. Après une dizaine de battement de cœur sans bouger, ils entendirent tous dans leur tête une voix leur dire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merci a vous charmante petite famille, j'avais faim et froid et vous m'avez accueilli, il est temps pour moi de continuer mon voyage mais je vous porterai toujours dans mon cœur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Au même moment tous réalisèrent que la licorne portait le même pull dans le quel la petite souris s’était endormie deux nuit auparavant, mais avant qu'ils ne puissent dire un mot la licorne disparaissait dans un halo lumineux ressemblant a un arc en ciel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2eme semaine - Le Jardin de l'amour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2021-12-06 (lundi)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le reste du petit dejeuner se passa dans silence relatif. Devant l'abatement des enfants leurs parents deciderent de profiter de l'acalmie de la tempete pour sortir toute la famille et aller se promener dans la foret. Celle-ci semblait completement differente maintenant que la neige avait tout recouvert et que les cristaux de givre creaient des formes totalement differentes. L'arbre prefere des enfants pour grimper, se cacher et se balancer etait completement differents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Au fur et a mesure que la famille s'enfoncait dans la foret a la recherche des sources chaudes pour un bain d'hiver la foret semblait changer a chaque pas. Apres dix minutes de marche les parents s'arreterent, se regarderent puis dirent a voix en meme temps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Je ne reconnais pas la foret, sommes nous perdus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mais au meme moment, seximus, le petit garcon dit a voix haute:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardez de la fumee, la-bas nous sommes aux sources chaudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cependant pere, mere, comme Secunda, Tertia et  Quarta savaient bien que les sources chaudes coulaient d'une petite colline avant de former une crique et non un petit geyser au milieu d'un etang. Aussi la presence de fleurs ouvertes et odorantes autour de l'etang etaient intriguante. Primo, l'aine et toujours le plus inquiet passa en arriere garde de la petite troupe et sortit sa hache de sa ceinture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQRDnRBFYp63tlU8UQ6ENpLZxopHGslmxoI0A&amp;amp;usqp=CAU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2021-12-07 (mardi)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alors qu'ils s'approchaient de l'etang ils commencerent a entendre des bruits de jeux et de franche rigolade. Comment quiconque aurait pu non seulement venir de la ville la plus lointaine en plein hiver mais aussi arriver si tot le matin apres une si terrible tempete?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alors qu'ils cheminaient le long d'un chemin qui semblait taille dans la roche, tel un canion les bruit devenaient de plus en plus fort. Puis lorsqu'ils contournerent le dernier rocher ils virent l'etang, les fumees chaudes s'en degageant et un groupe d'enfant jouant ensemble. D'abord interloques a la vue de la famille, ils sortirent de l'eau en courant et disparurent dans les buissons laissant deriere eux un enfant seul et effare: il ne retrouvait plus ses vetements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secunda s'approcha de lui, enleva son manteau et lui tendit. Bien que l'air chaud autour de la source les protege tous de l'hiver on put voir sur son visage un grand soulagemetn. Il prit le manteau et sans que l'on comprenne il disparut comme si les rochers avoisonant l'avaient absorbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2021-12-08 (mercredi)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perplexe, la famille ne sut ni que faire ni quoi dire.
Secunda habituee a donner des ordres a tout le monde, eleva la voix et dit a plein poumons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenez ici, nous pourrions tous jouer ensemble, l'etang est bien assez grand pour tous et l'hiver bien assez froid quand on s'eloigne de l'etang pour ne pas le partager.
Mais seul l'echo de ses paroles lui revint aux oreille. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apres quelques minutes supplementaires de stupefactions, ils se mirent tous a l'eau et commencerent a jouer ensemble dans cette eau si chaude qu'on en oubliait l'hiver. Ils jouerent ensemble pendant des heures comme ils l'avaient rarement fait depuis que les grands avaient commence a aller en ville pour apprendre ce qu'ils ne pouvaient apprendre a la maison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2021-12-09 (jeudi)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puis vint le moment de sortir la viande sechee des panier pour le repas. La chaleur autour du lac etait telle qu'ils n'eurent pas besoin de se secher pour manger et purent repousser le moment de se rabiller. Mais a peine s'etaient-ils assis qu'ils apercurent a portee de main, la ou le petit enfant avait disparut dans la roche des baies bien mures et en quantite telles qu'ils se demenderent tous comment ils avaient pu ne pas le voir avant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le repas copieux qui avaient prevus par les parents pour changer les idees resta en grande partie dans les paniers car la famille fut pratiquement rassasiee rien qu'en mangeant ces murs, ces mirtilles, ces framboises et ces fraises qu'ils n'avaient pas vu quelques heures au paravent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S'ils s'etaient moins goinfre des ces fruits d'ete, si rare en hiver, ils auraient pu penser que cet enfant qui avait disparu comme par magie semblait les remercier pour leur geste d'amour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2021-12-10 (vendredi)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quand leurs petites bedaines n'en pouvaient plus ils commencerent a se rabiller. C'est alors que Quatra entendit un son etrange, et comme a son habitude alla voir ce qu'il en etait curieuse qu'elle etait et bien heureuse d'avoir une excuse pour retarder son aide a ranger les affaires de la famille avant le retour a la maison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alors qu'elle s'avancait dans les buissons elle remarqua que la ligne de demarquation de la vegetation verte et de la neige sembalit s'etre raproche du lac mais n'y pretta pas grande attention intriguee et inquiete qu'elle etait d'entendre des bruits qui resemblait de plus en plus a des pleurs. Alors que la neige semblait maintenant a quelques pas d'elle, meme si elle n'en sentait pas encore le froid, elle finit par voir dans un arbre un filet et a l'interieur un jeune enfant qui ressemblait beaucoup a ceux qui avaient disparus a leur arrivee pres du lac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2021-12-11 (samedi)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inquiete que cet enfant puisse se blesser si le filet lachait, elle courut prevenir sa famille de sa decouverte. En un instant, ils avaient cesse leurs preparatifs et etaient venu avec elle pour lui preter main forte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A son retour, il lui fallu quelques temps pour retrouver l'enfant qui entre temps, probablement d'epuisement ou par peur de voire la famille au complet, avait arrete de faire du bruit. Il faut dire qu'en quelques minutes seulement la frontiere entre la neige et la vegetation luxuriante autour du lac avait avance d'une dizine de metre et l'enfant comme son filet etait maintenant recouvert de neige.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En passant la frontiere, ils se mirent tous a grelotter instantanement mais ne reculerent pas en voyant les levres bleues du petit enfant et ses membres qui ne sembaient plus bouger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2021-12-12 (dimanche)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quarta n'ecoutant que son courage cette fois s'elanca pour attraper les premieres branches de l'arbre et commenca a grimper a l'arbre pour defaire le noeud qui tenait le filet. L'enfant se reveilla et les voyant si proche et devinant leurs intentions se mit a hurler:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Fuyez avant que l'hiver soit completememnt installe, il m'a attrape et je ne m'en sortirai surement pas mas vous etes encore libre, fuyez vous dis-je!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Son agitation comme son inquietude etait perceptible dans sa voix mais cela ne finit que par renfocer la determination de Quarta. Tertia de son cote, avait commence a couper des petits branchages pour faire un tas sous le filet pour amortir la chute et tous bientot se joignirent a elle alors que Quarta se demenanit pour defaire le noeud de trappeur avec des doigts de plus en plus engourdi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rien ne sert de courir ; il faut partir à point. &lt;br&gt;
Le Lièvre et la Tortue en sont un témoignage. &lt;br&gt;
Gageons, dit celle-ci, que vous n'atteindrez point &lt;br&gt;
Si tôt que moi ce but. Si tôt ? Êtes-vous sage ?(1)   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repartit l'Animal léger.(2) &lt;br&gt;
Ma Commère, il vous faut purger  &lt;br&gt;
Avec quatre grains (3) d'ellébore. &lt;br&gt;
Sage ou non, je parie encore.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ainsi fut fait : et de tous deux &lt;br&gt;
On mit près du but les enjeux. &lt;br&gt;
Savoir quoi, ce n'est pas l'affaire ; &lt;br&gt;
Ni de quel juge l'on convint. (4) &lt;br&gt;
Notre Lièvre n'avait que quatre pas à faire ; &lt;br&gt;
J'entends de ceux qu'il fait lorsque prêt d'être atteint   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il s'éloigne des Chiens, les renvoie aux calendes, (5)  &lt;br&gt;
Et leur fait arpenter les landes. &lt;br&gt;
Ayant, dis-je, du temps de reste pour brouter, &lt;br&gt;
Pour dormir, et pour écouter   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D'où vient le vent, il laisse la Tortue &lt;br&gt;
Aller son train de Sénateur. (6) &lt;br&gt;
Elle part, elle s'évertue ; &lt;br&gt;
Elle se hâte avec lenteur.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lui cependant méprise une telle victoire ; &lt;br&gt;
Tient la gageure (7) à peu de gloire ; &lt;br&gt;
Croit qu'il y va de son honneur &lt;br&gt;
De partir tard. Il broute, il se repose, &lt;br&gt;
Il s'amuse à toute autre chose   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qu'à la gageure. À la fin, quand il vit &lt;br&gt;
Que l'autre touchait presque au bout de la carrière, (8)  &lt;br&gt;
Il partit comme un trait ; mais les élans qu'il fit &lt;br&gt;
Furent vains : la Tortue arriva la première.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eh bien, lui cria-t-elle, avais-je pas raison ? (9) &lt;br&gt;
De quoi vous sert votre vitesse ? &lt;br&gt;
Moi l'emporter ! et que serait-ce &lt;br&gt;
Si vous portiez une maison ?   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Il était une fois, un bon vieux et une bonne vieille.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Un jour la bonne vieille dit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Et si nous faisions un bonhomme de pain d'épice ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonne idée
répondit le bon vieux. Et ils se mirent aussitôt au travail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ils pétrirent la pâte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;l' étalèrent au rouleau à pâtisserie,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;firent ses petits bras&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;firent ses petites jambes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;puis firent enfin une jolie petite tête.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enfin avec de plein de petits raisins secs ils firent une bouche et avec des gros raisins ils firent un nez et deux yeux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puis avec du glacage de toutes les coleurs ils lui firent un joli costume traditionnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quand tout fut prêt, ils le mirent au four et attendirent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apres quelque temps la bonne vieille dit: 
- Hum ! que ça sent bon ! Ce petit bonhomme de pain d'épice devrait être prêt maintenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;et elle ouvrit la porte du fourneau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mais à peine avaient-ils ouvert la porte du four que le Bonhomme de pain d'épice bondit et s'échappa à toutes jambes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le bon vieux et la bonne vieille n'en crurent pas leurs yeux !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Et alors, le Bonhomme de pain, plantant ses mains sur ses hanches, dit d'un air moqueur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courrez, courrez, courrez
Aussi vite que vous le pourrez,
Jamais vous ne pourrez me rattraper
Je suis le Bonhomme de pain d'épice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le bon vieux se pencha pour l'attraper, mais rapide comme l'éclair le Bonhomme de pain d'épice passa entre ses jambes et s'enfuit en courant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le bon vieux et la bonne vieille se mirent à courir derrière lui en hurlant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviens, Reviens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mais le Bonhomme de pain d'épice répondit en courant de plus belle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non, Non,
Jamais je ne reviendrai
Mieux vaux courir
Que finir en goûter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Et il se remit a courir de plus belle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;et il courut, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;courut, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;courut encore et encore!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apres un certain temps, il arriva a la devanture d'une boucherie et vit le boucher qui passait le balais &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;alors, le Bonhomme de pain d'épice, plantant ses mains sur ses hanches, dit d'un air moqueur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courrez, courrez, courrez
Aussi vite que vous le pourrez,
Jamais vous ne pourrez me rattraper
Je suis le Bonhomme de pain d'épice
J'ai échappé au bon vieux,
J'ai échappé à la bon vieille
Je vous échapperai aussi, 
Foi de Bonhomme de pain d'épice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le boucher se baissa pour l'attraper, mais rapide comme l'éclair le Bonhomme de pain d'épice lui glissa entre le doigts et s'enfuit en courant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le boucher se mit à courir derrière lui en hurlant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviens, Reviens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;et juste derrière lui on entendait le bon vieux et la bonne vieille qui hurlaient aussi &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviens, Reviens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mais le Bonhomme de pain d'épice répondit en courant de plus belle&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non, Non,

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Et il se remit a courir de plus belle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;et il courut, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;courut, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;courut encore et encore!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apres un certain temps, il arriva a la cloture d'un champ et vit une vache qui broutait &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;alors, le Bonhomme de pain d'épice, plantant ses mains sur ses hanches, dit d'un air moqueur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courrez, courrez, courrez
Aussi vite que vous le pourrez,
Jamais vous ne pourrez me rattraper
Je suis le Bonhomme de pain d'épice
J'ai échappé au bon vieux,
J'ai échappé à la bonne vieille
J'ai échappé au boucher et à son couteau
Je vous échapperai aussi, 
Foi de Bonhomme de pain d'épice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le vache tourna la tete brusquement pour l'attraper, mais rapide comme l'éclair le Bonhomme de pain d'épice lui glissa entre les dents et s'enfuit en courant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La vache se mit à courir derrière lui en meuglant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviens, Reviens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;et juste derrière elle on entendait le boucher qui hurlait aussi &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviens, Reviens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;et juste derrière lui on entendait le bon vieux et la bonne vieille qui hurlaient aussi &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Et il se remit a courir de plus belle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;et il courut, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;courut, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;courut encore et encore!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apres un certain temps, il arriva à une ferme et vit une truie pleine de bouge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;alors, le Bonhomme de pain d'épice, plantant ses mains sur ses hanches, dit d'un air moqueur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courrez, courrez, courrez
Aussi vite que vous le pourrez,
Jamais vous ne pourrez me rattraper
Je suis le Bonhomme de pain d'épice
J'ai échappé au bon vieux,
J'ai échappé à la bonne vieille

J'ai échappé à la vache noire et blanche
Je vous échapperai aussi, 
Foi de Bonhomme de pain d'épice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le truie leva une pate brusquement pour l'écraser, mais rapide comme l'éclair le Bonhomme de pain d'épice lui glissa entre les pates et s'enfuit en courant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La truie se mit à courir derrière lui en grognant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviens, Reviens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;et juste derrière elle on entendait le vache qui meuglait aussi &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviens, Reviens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;et juste derrière elle on entendait le boucher qui hurlait aussi &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviens, Reviens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;et juste derrière lui on entendait le bon vieux et la bonne vieille qui hurlaient aussi &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviens, Reviens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mais le Bonhomme de pain d'épice répondit en courant de plus belle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non, Non,
Jamais je ne reviendrai

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Et il se remit a courir de plus belle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;et il courut, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;courut, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;courut encore et encore!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayant bien courut il arriva à la lisiaire d'une foret ou il recontra un renard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;alors, le Bonhomme de pain d'épice, plantant ses mains sur ses hanches, dit d'un air moqueur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courrez, courrez, courrez
Aussi vite que vous le pourrez,
Jamais vous ne pourrez me rattraper
Je suis le Bonhomme de pain d'épice
J'ai échappé au bon vieux,
J'ai échappé à la bonne vieille
J'ai échappé au boucher et à son couteau
J'ai échappé à la vache noire et blanche
Je vous échapperai aussi, 
Foi de Bonhomme de pain d'épice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mais le renard, très rusé et faisant semblant de ne pas bien entendre lui dit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Que dis-tu? Je ne suis plus tout jeune. Viens plus près et parle plus fort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;le Bonhomme de pain d'épice s'approcha et répéta, en hurlant cette fois:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courrez, courrez, courrez
Aussi vite que vous le pourrez,
Jamais vous ne pourrez me rattraper
Je suis le Bonhomme de pain d'épice
J'ai échappé au bon vieux,
J'ai échappé à la bonne vieille
J'ai échappé au boucher et à son couteau
J'ai échappé à la vache noire et blanche
Je vous échapperai aussi, 
Foi de Bonhomme de pain d'épice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juste à ce moment arrivèrent, au détour du chemin la truie pleine de boue, la vache noir et blanc, le boucher et son grand couteau et le bon vieux avec la bonne vieille qui hurlaient tous ensemble:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviens, Reviens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le Bonhomme de pain d'épice tourna la tête pour les regarder, ouvrit la bouche pour les railler. Mais avant qu'il n'ait pu prononcer un mot, le renard bondit et le croqua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estomaqués, la truie pleine de boue, la vache noir et blanc, le boucher et son grand couteau et le bon vieux avec la bonne vieille regarderent le renard avec des yeux plein de reproches: il ne leur avait meme pas laisse une miette !&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ATU"></category><category term="ATU2025"></category></entry><entry><title>Meng Jiangnü</title><link href="https://oberron.github.io/spark-fi/meng-jiangnu.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-08-01T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-08-01T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Oberron</name></author><id>tag:oberron.github.io,2021-08-01:/spark-fi/meng-jiangnu.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Meng Jiangnü (chinois 孟姜女 , pinyin Mèng Jiāng Nǚ)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On raconte qu’autrefois en Chine, à l’époque de l'Empereur Qin Shihuang (l'empereur fondateur de la dynastie Qin qui regna de 221 à 207 av. J.-C.), 
 vivaient à Badaling, dans les montagnes au nord de Pékin, 
 deux familles dont les maisons étaient collées l’une à l’autre, séparées seulement par un petit muret. 
 À l’est du mur se trouvait la maison de la famille Meng, et à l’ouest, celle de la famille Jiang. 
 Les deux familles s’aidaient mutuellement et vivaient en harmonie, comme si elles ne formaient qu’une famille. 
 Elles avaient une vie heureuse, mais partageaient un problème commun : elles n’avaient pas de descendants.
Un printemps, la famille Meng planta une graine. 
La liane qui poussa alors grimpa, et se noua avec une autre qui se trouvait de l’autre côté du mur. 
Les deux familles prirent grand soin de la plante, qui donna bientôt une courge splendide ; tous ceux qui l’apercevaient louaient sa forme grande et ronde.
Puis arrivèrent la fin de l’automne et le moment de récolter le légume. Les Meng proposèrent que les Jiang le cueillent.
     — La plante a donné la courge de votre côté, dirent-ils aux Jiang, elle vous revient.
     Mais les Jiang considéraient les Meng comme les propriétaires légitimes.
     — La courge a été plantée de votre côté, dirent-ils aux Jiang, vous devez la garder.
Les deux familles se renvoyant les politesses, elles décidèrent finalement que la courge serait coupée en deux, et que chacune en obtiendrait la moitié.
Lorsque la courge fut coupée, tout le monde fut ébahi : le légume ne contenait ni chair ni graines, mais une petite fille ! 
La fillette était très belle, resplendissante de santé, et était tout sourire. Les Meng et les Jiang étaient fous de joie ; 
ils pensèrent qu’il s’agissait d’un cadeau du Ciel. C’est pourquoi ils décidèrent d’élever la petite fille comme leur propre enfant. Mais il fallait lui donner un nom.
     — Puisque c’est la fille de nos deux familles, proposa le couple Meng, nous n’avons qu’à l’appeler « Fille des Meng et des Jiang » : Meng Jiangnü (car Nǚ en chinois veut dire jeune fille).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le temps passa, et plus d'une dizaine d’années s’écoula comme le clignement d’un œil, et Meng Jiangnü était devenue une jeune fille à la fois belle et intelligente.
À cette époque, l’empereur Qin Shihuang venait à peine de vaincre ses adversaires et voulait démarrer à Badaling la construction d’une muraille. 
Le chantier nécessitait le recrutement de dizaine de milliers d’ouvriers ; partout, des travailleurs étaient enrôlés de force. 
Ceux qui étaient mobilisés travaillaient dans des conditions épouvantables, œuvrant de jour comme de nuit. 
Ils n’étaient pas assez nourris, ni convenablement vêtus, et recevaient les coups des gardes. Innombrables étaient ceux qui mouraient sur le chantier.
Parmi ces travailleurs figurait un jeune homme instruit qui s’appelait Fan Qiliang. 
Il ne supportait plus les conditions de ce labeur, à tel point qu’une nuit, à la faveur de l’obscurité, il s’évada. 
Il courut à perdre haleine. À l’aube, il était arrivé aux alentours d’un hameau. 
Il y avait là quelques maisons, à l’arrière desquelles se trouvait un jardin, dont le camouflage d’une vigne suspendue offrait une parfaite cachette. 
Il pensa alors s’y dissimuler et attendre que la nuit revienne pour reprendre sa course. Fan Qiliang était à peine entré qu’un hurlement se fit entendre :
     — Qui va là ? Qui est là ?
C’était Meng Jiangnü ; elle prenait soin du jardin lorsqu’elle avait aperçu la silhouette d’un homme. 
M. Meng accourut, alarmé par le cri de sa fille, et s’empressa de demander à Fan Qiliang :
     — Qui êtes-vous donc ? Et que faites-vous ici ?
     — Je suis un refugié, répondit Fan Qiliang, qui raconta son histoire.
Le vieux Meng s’apitoya sur le sort de ce jeune homme et lui fit une proposition.
     — Ces jours-ci, les militaires recrutent intensément dans la région. Vous n’avez qu’à rester à l’abri chez nous pendant quelques jours.
Peu après, M. Meng, estimant que sa fille n’était déjà plus une enfant, et qu’il était temps pour elle de trouver un époux, parla à son épouse :
     — Ce jeune homme que nous accueillons chez nous depuis plusieurs jours est instruit, honnête et zélé, pourquoi ne pas le marier à Meng Jiangnü ?
      — Je suis d’accord, répondit Mme Meng, ce jeune homme conviendrait parfaitement. Mais il nous faut en discuter également  avec la famille Jiang.
Les Jiang furent enchantés de cette proposition. Meng Jiangnü et Fan Qiliang étaient épris l’un de l’autre, et c’est ainsi que les Meng et les Jiang eurent un gendre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malheureusement, à peine un mois après la noce, l’officier en charge du village suspecta Fan Qiliang d’être un fugitif ; 
 il envoya une unité de soldats pour l’arrêter et le renvoyer sur le chantier de la Grande Muraille. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meng Jiangnü allait chaque jour à l’entrée du village, regardant au loin, dans l’espoir qu’un messager arrive avec une lettre pour elle ;
 mais son époux ne donnait aucune nouvelle. Parfois, la jeune femme croisait des voyageurs venant du nord, et elle s’empressait alors de les interroger.
Mais personne n’avait de nouvelles à lui apporter. Comment se portait Fan Qiliang ? Était-il désormais mieux traité ?
N’était-il pas malade ? Quand pourrait-il revenir ? Toutes ces questions s’entremêlaient dans l’esprit de Meng Jiangnü, qui ne trouvait plus le sommeil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;À l’arrivée de l’hiver, le vent glacial du nord ouest, coupant comme un rasoir, commença à souffler. 
Meng Jiangnü pensa que son mari était plus au nord, dans les montagnes où le vent devait souffler bien plus fort encore. 
Là-bas, en plus du vent, il fallait également résister à la neige et au froid. 
Comment Fan Qiliang pourrait-il s’adapter à des conditions si rudes, vêtu seulement des quelques habits qu’il portait le jour de son départ ?
La jeune femme se mit à confectionner des vêtements d’hiver. 
Elle n’eut de cesse d’employer ses ciseaux pour que son époux puisse résister à la rigueur de la saison des neiges.
Tandis qu’elle s’affairait, elle formulait le vœu que le vent souffle moins fort, que le climat se radoucisse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Un matin, Meng Jiangnü rassembla des vivres et toutes les affaires qu’elle voulait apporter à Fan Qiliang ; 
elle salua ses quatre parents et se mit en route à travers les chemins de montagne, vers le chantier où l’on bâtissait la Grande Muraille. 
Pendant tout le trajet, elle ne se découragea pas, déterminée à retrouver son mari au plus vite. 
Chaque soir, lorsque la nuit tombait, elle se mettait en quête d’un lieu où dormir, et dès le petit matin, elle reprenait sa course en direction du nord, 
faisant face à des tempêtes de neige.
Un jour, à la faveur d’une matinée ensoleillée, elle aperçut à l’horizon, sur la blancheur immaculée de la montagne, 
une ligne noire qui serpentait le long des crêtes et des pics. 
Elle pensa qu’il s’agissait de la Grande Muraille, et que si tel était le cas, son mari n’était désormais plus très loin.
Lorsqu’elle atteignit le chantier, Meng Jiangnü interrogea un groupe de travailleurs qui transportaient des pierres.
     — Nous avons connu un homme qui s’appelait Fan Qiliang, répondirent les ouvriers, il a travaillé non loin d’ici et s’est ensuite échappé. 
     Mais il a été rattrapé, et lorsqu’il est revenu, il a été battu à mort.
Meng Jiangnü était anéantie, elle ne voulait pas croire à cette issue tragique.
     — Mais alors, où sa dépouille a-t-elle été enterrée ?
     — Sa dépouille ? Dans ces montagnes, nous sommes des milliers à mourir chaque jour. 
     Nous ne pouvons même pas prendre soin de nous-mêmes, ne parlons pas des cadavres ! Les corps de ceux qui ont trépassé, on les jette dans la muraille !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meng Jiangnü avait fait un si long voyage, et elle ne pouvait même pas voir la dépouille de son mari défunt.
Elle se sentit envahie par une immense fureur et laissa éclater sa colère et son chagrin face à la muraille, à l’endroit où Fan Qiliang avait été enseveli.
La force de sa tristesse attendrit le Ciel, si bien que les nuages couvrirent tout à coup le soleil, le tonnerre se fit entendre et la foudre accompagna l’orage.
Une véritable tornade s’abattit. 
En poussant un terrible gémissement de désespoir, Meng Jiangnü fit s’effondrer un pan entier de la muraille, libérant des milliers d’ossements.
Ne pouvant distinguer où étaient les restes de son mari, Meng Jiangnü se mordit le doigt et laissa couler une goutte de son sang à terre. Elle interpella le Ciel :
     — Que mon sang me mène à Fan Qiliang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C’est ainsi que la goutte de sang ruissela jusqu’à l’endroit précis où le corps du jeune lettré avait été enterré, réunissant une dernière fois les deux époux.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ATU"></category><category term="ATUCH0002"></category></entry><entry><title>Private key pentagram</title><link href="https://oberron.github.io/spark-fi/private-key-pentagram.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-07-20T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-07-20T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Oberron</name></author><id>tag:oberron.github.io,2021-07-20:/spark-fi/private-key-pentagram.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Pentagrams are like public keys to access energy bots.

&lt;p&gt;L’histoire se passe lors de la Dynastie Song (il y a mille an) dans la ville de Hangzhou.
Hangzhou est situee en Chine orientale au sud du delta du Yangzi Jiang, elle compte de nos jours environ 10 millions d'habitants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lu Dongbin 吕洞宾, un des Huit Immortels, se déguisa en vendeur de Tangyuan (des boulettes de farine de riz gluant consommées dans une soupe d'eau sucrée ou dans du bouillon de viande) 
au "Pont Brisé" , se trouvant sur le Lac de l'Ouest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tangyuan, credit wikipedia" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Pumpkin_tangyuan_%28%E6%B1%A4%E5%9C%86%29_with_red_bean_baste_and_black_sesame_fillings.jpg/420px-Pumpkin_tangyuan_%28%E6%B1%A4%E5%9C%86%29_with_red_bean_baste_and_black_sesame_fillings.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xu Xian 许仙, un apothicaire assez pauvre, lui acheta quelques Tangyuan sans savoir que c'était en fait des pilules d'immortalité. 
Pendant les trois jours suivants, il ne se sentit pas bien et n'avait aucun appétit. 
Il retourna donc voir Lu Dongbin pour lui parler de son problème dû aux Tangyuan. Celui-ci se mit à rire et renversa Xu Xuan du pont ce qui le fit vomir.
Dans le Lac de l'Ouest, se trouvait un Serpent Blanc qui pratiquait la magie taoïste. 
Elle espérait devenir un Immortel après avoir médité pendant des siècles (car le serpent est une femme) mangea les pilules et obtint 500 ans de pouvoirs magiques. 
Une tortue se trouvant dans le Lac, qui elle aussi aspirait à devenir Immortelle, était folle de jalousie due au fait de ne pas avoir pu manger les pilules. 
Le serpent quant à lui se sentit alors reconnaissante envers Xu Xian l'apothicaire et fit la promesse de lui rendre son bienfait dans une prochaine vie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Un peu plus tard, le Serpent Blanc vit un mendiant essayer de sortir un serpent vert de l'eau afin de le vendre. 
Le Serpent Blanc se transforma alors en jeune femme et lui acheta le serpent dans le but de sauver celui-ci. 
Le serpent vert se sentit redevable envers le serpent blanc et la considéra comme sa grande sœur.
Par la suite, le serpent blanc et le serpent vert se mirent à méditer pendant 18 ans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grâce à cette méditation, elles acquièrent des pouvoirs dont celui de prendre forme humaine.
Le serpent blanc, ayant pris la forme d’une jeune femme, se mit alors à la recherche de son bienfaiteur et apprit son nom ainsi que l’endroit où il officiait.
C'est pendant le Festival de Qingming (la fete de nettoyage des tombes), lors d’une promenade autour du Lac de l'Ouest, sur le Pont Brisé, qu’elles tombèrent sur lui. 
Ne trouvant aucun moyen de commencer la conversation, et s’apercevant qu’il tenait dans sa main un parapluie, elles utilisèrent leur pouvoir pour faire tomber la pluie.
Il proposa alors de raccompagner les deux jeunes femmes qui se présentèrent sous les noms respectifs de Bai Suzhen 白素贞 pour le Serpent Blanc (Bai signifiant blanc) 
et Xiaoqing 小青 (Qing signifiant vert) pour le Serpent Vert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xu Xian tomba amoureux de Bai Suzhen et ils se marièrent. 
Bai Suzhen aidait Xu Xian dans ses affaires en mettant son pouvoir dans les fioles des médicaments sans que ce denier ne le sache. 
L'affaire prospéra et Bai Suzhen tomba enceinte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Un jour, Xu Xian rencontra un moine bouddhiste nomme Fahai 法海. 
Fahai était la forme humaine de la tortue qui se trouvait dans le Lac de l'Ouest. 
Celle-ci avait assez médité pour se transformer et en voulait toujours au serpent concernant les pilules. 
Fahai senti une aura très Yin sur Xu Xian et cet aura n'est autre qu'un esprit. 
Il prévient donc Xu Xian du danger, mais il ne l'écouta pas. Il proposa alors à Xu Xian de faire boire à sa femme du vin soufré lors de la Fête des Bateaux Dragons. 
Le vin soufré est généralement servi aux personnes malades, mais sert aussi de répulsif contre les serpents. 
Après avoir essuyé plusieurs refus, Bai Suzhen accepta de boire le vin et finit par retrouver sa forme originelle. Xu Xian fut tellement choqué qu'il mourut sur le coup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forte de son amour pour son mari, Bai Suzhen partit en direction du Mont Emei, montagne où résident les divinités, 
pour acquérir une potion magique permettant de ressusciter Xu Xian, et ce, au péril de sa vie, car les esprits ne peuvent entrer dans les endroits sacrés. 
Elle réussit à ressusciter Xu Xian et il confirma son amour pour elle malgré sa forme. Mais Fahai lui était bien décidé à se débarrasser d’elle. 
Il kidnappa Xu Xian et l'enferma dans le Temple Jinshan 金山寺. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bai Suzhen et Xiaoqing engagèrent donc un combat avec Fahai pour libérer Xu Xian. Bai Suzhen inonda alors le temple et noya ainsi beaucoup d'innocents. 
Dû à sa condition, Bai Suzhen n'avait plus beaucoup de pouvoirs alors elle échoua dans sa tâche pour sauver son mari. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus tard, Xu Xian arriva à s'échapper du temple et à retrouver sa femme au moment où elle donnait naissance à leur fils : Xu Mengjiao 许梦娇. 
Mais Fahai n’en avait pas fini avec eux et les retrouva. Il engagea un nouveau combat avec Bai Suzhen et l'enferma dans la Pagode Leifeng 雷峰塔.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vingt ans plus tard, Xu Mengjiao obtint le plus haut grade des Examens Impériaux et retourna à Hangzhou pour présenter ses respects à sa mère. 
On dit que le Ciel était tellement ému de la dévotion de Xu Mengjiao qu’ils libérèrent Bai Suzhen de la Pagode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xiaoqing, qui avait juré de se venger de Fahai et qui avait médité depuis tout ce temps pour retrouver ses pouvoirs, alla à sa rencontre afin de le combattre. 
Xiaoqing sortit vainqueur du combat ce qui mena Fahai à s’enfuir dans le ventre d'un crabe. 
On dit alors que la couleur orange qui se trouve à l'intérieur du crabe est due à la couleur de la toge de Fahai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De nos jours, vous pouvez visiter la célèbre pagode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ce n'est plus la même pagode qu'à l'époque car elle a été détruite lors d'un tremblement de terre au début du 20e siècle, mais au premier étage vous pouvez voir la légende du serpent blanc en gravure.
C'est de toute beauté ! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characters
Key Charcter: Massimo. Brilliant journalist (failed jesuit priest) and amateur opera singer. Well travelled. Recently came back to France for moral reasons (did not like how commercial journalism was evolving in NY). Looks a lot like Don Camillio.
Side kick: ??? (actually Massimo's daugther but he nor the reader knows at first). Very good but full of herself and extremly arrogant. She looks a lot like Scully in X-Files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;story line:
opening scene: scary chase with yet to be identified character chased by "red intelligent eyes" to be later identified as kangaroos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial situation:
Massimo struggling in Paris to find jobs as "pigist" paid per article&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disruption: Summer holiday all key journalist gone and some weird epidemy starting in Rambouillet affecting more and more teenagers found in Persistent vegetative state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action:
Massimo arrives in Rambouillet fighting the local "upper class" which wants to keep a tight lead on this story but finds help in the middle/low class which are worried that since their kids cannot leave for summer camps abroad are more likely to be exposed.
Massimo's side kick thanks to her mother's relation helps him (though not willingly) identify that most bodies were found in the part of the forest were the kangaroos live in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolution:
While Massimo going through his old contacts finds correlatino between the medical files and a condition called "intellectual shock" which is a "alternative truth" case, M's side kick establishes that some of the first kids had just come back from Australia and were known drug dealers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:
While Massimo tries some aborigenes medicine trick to remove the "intellectual shock" condition his side kick convinces doctors to proceed to a blood dialysis to remove drugs which could not be detected but might be present.
While no one believes either dialysis or aborigenes' tricks can work the kids end up waking up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We end learning from M's side kick when "reporting" to her mum that she is actually M's daughter.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Le loup le renard et le pot de miel</title><link href="https://oberron.github.io/spark-fi/le-loup-le-renard-et-le-pot-de-miel.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-10T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2020-10-10T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Oberron</name></author><id>tag:oberron.github.io,2020-10-10:/spark-fi/le-loup-le-renard-et-le-pot-de-miel.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Une des nombreuses variantes du vol de nourriture en pretendant etre le parrain&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Un jour, le Renard et le Loup voyageaient de compagnie.

&lt;p&gt;Tandis que le Loup marchait devant, le Renard courut manger à moitié le pot de miel. Cinq minutes plus tard,

pour ces pratiques que nous inventames il y a des decennies. Ou aurais-tu vu un fantome de ces fermiers africains ou d'Indonésie qui
furent les dommages collatéraux de notre montée en puissance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- John, enfin voyons. Nous commençâmes ce commerce ensemble. Non, cette fois c'est pire. Nous courons a la ruine. Nous sommes
excessivement exposés à une variation extrême des prix du papier toilette. Hors celui-ci ne bouge pas de plus de quelques pourcents chaque année."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Un long silence suivit, puis une voix caverneuse répondit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"- La seule solution est une pandémie réellement mondiale. La panique créera une telle tension sur les prix que la production ne pourra
pas suivre. Trouve un laboratoire avec les souches virales les plus dangereuses, un BSL-P4. Assure-toi qu'une souche extremment contagieuse 
s'en échape à la fin de l'automne!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then one night he woke up suddendly, went to his laboratory, modified the artifact he had inherited for wand making and produce the first lot of very small wands for kids. he had replaced dragon scales or unicorn hair with colored clay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for weeks his grand kids discovered the joy of colouring and he felt releaved not to loose hair by the handful anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;until when the next order for magic wand came, ... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he realised sudendly that moving on the only magic possible, once the last magic wand would run out magic, was kids doing colouring as he had modified the artifact beyond the point of return.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="fiction"></category></entry><entry><title>dark matter</title><link href="https://oberron.github.io/spark-fi/dark-matter.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-08-06T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-08-06T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Oberron</name></author><id>tag:oberron.github.io,2019-08-06:/spark-fi/dark-matter.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Romeo loved Juliette and she loved him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Suppose we now consider a totally nonredundant television broadcast: one in which each dot is un correlated with the other dots on the same frame and
each frame is unrelated to other frames. No human being could possibly absorb information from a television tube at such a rate. Even if the material being
broadcast were a typical printed page (and on such a page there is a great deal of correlation between dots), it would take a person of reasonable skills about
60 seconds to absorb the information from one frame. Thus we can estimate the probable bit rate required to engage a human being in intellectual attention
as being **less than 10^4 bits per second**
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;With a world population of less than five billion, the entire human race could have its information channels individually serviced and saturated with a bit rate
of 5 X 10^13, very much less than the 10^38 bits per second available. 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;The total muscle-power output of the human race is estimated to be about 3 X10^9 megawatt-hours per year (somewhat less than one megawatt-hour per person
per year).

 in London and New-York, I now have to work for "Leurs secrets caches" (1) (Note 1: Their hidden secrets), the only
 newspa- per ready to give me a chance for a paper in France."
Massimo had been going through those dark angered feelings when suddenly a voice that seemed to come from nowhere interrupted his train of thoughts :
"Cheer up Massimo! You've got to stop complaining", Cheerio urged as he gulped the remains of his beer.
"I do not think you understand", replied Massimo: "I've worked for the best and the biggest! All over the place: the New York Times, the Telegraph, ... And now this!
Some crack pot mag for crack pots to further their paranoia and suspicion...
-You're drinking that?"
Massimo pushed his untouched beer towards his thirsty friend.
"Ta mate! Listen! Don't beat yourself up it's a means to an end. Write one arti- cle and you'll get another within a month"
Massimo expression deepened, moving from the face of XXX (opera charac- ter) to YYY (opera character).
Cheerio, maybe getting a clear insight in his mate's mood, thanks to the alco- hol, came to realise that the issue was deeper than he had first thought

"&amp;gt;OK Massimio, why don't you go over this interview again?"
"-I've told you everything there was to say about this disgusting slimy pig" "-Maybe but why don't you try again?"
"-OK [description]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 2 - Contempt /Arrival in Rambouillet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Arrivee a Rambouillet" src="http://www.cartes-et-patrimoine.com/images/11/9/photos-carte-rambouillet-yvelines-PH059348-A.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing Massimo noticed when he walked in the hotel lobby was the sign saying "NO VACANCIES". When the "hotel owner" walked in after 2 good min- utes, Massimo could not believe what he saw. The man, was the impossible son of Elvis Presley and Freddie Mercury. Indeed the hair and the fat face could have been Elvis' while the moustache and the way to walk could have been Freddie when singing on stage "Bohemian Rapsody". What maid it worse was the music coming of the back room, a bad remix of rock music from an amateur band. Mas- simo's well trained hear hurt not only because the instruments were not tuned but the rythm was as irregular as the heart of an "centenaire" prone to fibrillation... Once over the initial shock Massimo asked:
" Hi, I may have knocked on the wrong door, isn't this the &lt;Zauberflöte of Rambouillet&gt;?
- It still is for another few weeks. It was my dad's hotel and he was vexed classi- cal music Flute player but I always hated that sloppy music. I'll rename it R&amp;amp;R with a graphical like RollsRoys but actually meaning Rambouillet Rapshody. Do you want to see the logo for the hotel? I was just working on it ..."
Massimo suddenly felt he had to interrupt this torrent of words before his head would be crushed between the inept attitude from his lodger for the next few days and the music background.
"-I would love to but I have had a difficult day, do you have booking in the name of Massimo ?
7
 -Hum let me look, the books are not kept as well since my dad retired... Where did I put this paper... Do you know that we are full? Ho, but you probably called before I took the last booking... Hmm actually how am I sure that I am full since ..." the words were coming out of his mouth quicker and quicker and were slowly covered by the background noise coming out of his lodge. Massimo's head which had been already hurting after the difficult start of his day was on the edge of im- plosion, when suddenly he heard something soothing
"Ah, now I remember I put the name with the last keys to be sure, let's have a look, ..., the two keys left are 502 and 503. 503 Cecilia blabla, nop not him, 502 Massimo ‘the italian’. Here we are. Mr Massimo, here is your key.
&lt;night time&gt;
&lt;morning time&gt;
Cecilia blearily surveyed the dinning area. There he is, that's the one, she start- ed to drum her fingers irritably on the table. Oh that's right, she thought, yeah come over here, all the breakfast tables and you choose the one next to mine arah! Her drumming became more agitated as the tall dark looking man, who looked like a mix between a bread of parisian intellectual salons with his scarf wrapped around his neck early in the morning and a foreigner, maybe american, with his entire set displaying a brand logo, took his seat.
Urgh now he's humming, Cecilia, infuriated couldn't hold back;
"'Do you mind?!" she snapped, "I'd like a bit of quiet while I eat my breakfast.
-Well, I have to hum to drown out the noise of your drumming" chuckled Massimo.
"And what am I supposed to do to drown out the sound of your radio when I'm trying to sleep?" Cecilia was struggling to keep control, she wasn't good with- out sleep at the best of times and after driving all night, only to be woken early the next morning by this selfish man blasting opera from the room next door.
'Radio? But my room did not even have an alarm clock' answered Massimo with a puzzled look on his face.

'I know it was you. Your room 502 aren't you? 6am this morning bloody opera, woken up, trying to sleep?
'Oh that wasn't the radio.' Massimo's confused expression cleared into one of embarrassment.'I'msorryifIwokeyou,butthatwasme. Ioftensinginthe shower. I had no idea it would carry into your room.'
Cecillia was equally embarrassed by this point but was not about to show it, "yeah well you should have realised how load it was,' then conceded, "but it did sound very good, professional infact."
Massimo didn't need any more invitation than that. "Do you think so?' He beamed as he jumped up from his seat and pulled out the chair opposite Cecillia. Cecillia groaned inwardly as she heard all the in-depth details of the opera circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 3 - Surprise /First steps in Rambouillet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[in this chapter we see Cecilia and Masimo starting their investigations in Ram- bouillet, we give descriptions of the different places in Rambouillet as well as the forest were they go trying to find the kangaroos. they also encounter some "resis- tance" from locals not really happy about the publicity this gives to Rambouillet]
[here we also get first incidents coming from the television team which puzzle Cecilia]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 4 - Excitement /Things get more complex&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Cecilia and them Massimo meet a strange gardener who is the first one to give them some help about the kids in hospital who called themselves the Macropus and are all now in hospital]
[more annoyance from television team which denies everything].
As Massimo made his way in Kevin’s flat in the maze of shelves storing foreign books and manuscripts which looked anything like he had ever seen, he wondered how is brother had ever met or heard of this strange character. Kevin was indeed nothing like his brother, who was like him, a caricature of their latin blood. Kevin on the other hand seemed afraid of human interactions and appeared to have suc- ceeded in his quest to add as many layers of literature between him and the world of the leavings. These thoughts distracted Massimo enough to make him trip on a heap of unannounced, by the look of it Chinese, literature. As he lost his balance, he reached out for the nearest object jetting out from the shelves and cut himself on the rusted rings holding together some rotting paper. As he cursed Kevin, Mas- simo could not help thinking why on earth someone would store any sort of paper older than yesterday’s news. The noise of his near fall, was covered immediately by screams coming right behind the next shelves, which reminded immediately Massimo of the strange character he was about to meet again.
[...]
"Well, I have looked at the unknown organic molecules in the blood analysis. It is quite normal as the mass chromatographer they used is an old one with very limited database.
11
- Can you use plane language?
- This is plain language !". Screamed Kevin back, his saliva nearly hitting Mas- simo tie. Massimo remembered the advice he was given about interacting with Kevin and tried a more specific angle:
"-Could you tell me how this tool with a database is called usually on television and radio ?
- Well, while highly inaccurate and irrelevant, Patrick-Poivre d’Arvor (Author’s Note: Patrick Poivre d’Arvor or PPDA is a famous french journalist which pre- sented the main 20h00 news for many years) used the following words on April 28th, 1992 "the machine which is the Rosetta’s stone for translating molecules language."
- So, how could the machine not know the molecules found in the kids blood?" Asked Massimo
- The machines are programmed with the relevant information and only very expensive machines can analyse all molecules, as this was a machine used for hu- man biology, those were not added to the database to avoid excessive costs.
- OK, so if this is not supposed to be found in human biology, what are those molecules?
- It took me a lot of time to go through all possible options. I first had to find a empty time for the X-ray 3D analyser of the university of Paris X. The structure is very similar to the one of the 3 main monoamines neurotransmitters: sero- tonin, dopamine and noradrenaline which the body generates. However it is nei- ther of them. If not totally against any biology text book I would say this is a fourth one.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="novel"></category></entry><entry><title>poppies</title><link href="https://oberron.github.io/spark-fi/poppies.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-05-24T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2014-05-24T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Oberron</name></author><id>tag:oberron.github.io,2014-05-24:/spark-fi/poppies.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Coquelicots" src="https://oberron.github.io/spark-fi/posts/images/Claude_Monet_037.jpg" title="Claude Monet 037 - Les Coquelicots (from Wikipedia)"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will always remember the hot summer 1976. The heat for sure was extreme and it is the main reason this summer is memorable
for everyone. For me, it is quite different as I was having my first summer job doing wheat harvest in a small Neolithic farm exper-
iment on the hills of Provence. The head of the farm experiment wanted to see what the life of the first farmers had been like and had
found land and for years farmed it with plough pulled by donkeys and only natural excremental as fertilisers. The work was hard all
through the day from sunrise till sunset to be able to harvest everything before the first summer storms which would have destroyed
the harvest but I still have my eyes filled with the sun dried yellow of the wheat and the red of all those poppies which were complementing so beautifully together. For the years to come whenever I would travel through the country side during the months of harvest, my heart would always sink with sorrow when seeing those empty seas of wheat deprived of the poppies which I used to see as little red ships which I had come to love seeing so much riding on the wheat.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later after retiring from a long carrier as naval oficer, I decided to fill our little garden with poppies in a little patch where
I would grow wheat to fill the view from our back window. I believe that in doing this I passed this passion which I now shared with my
beloved wife for this impressionist view for a few weeks of the year to my kids and grand children at the very least as even the youngest
one has taken the name of Poppy as his summer nickname. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfew, university is over and hopefully the nickname Popy which my grandad gave me years ago may now be left behind. However
my heart sinks with sorrow as for the first time since I can remember things, I will not be able to go and visit my grand parents in
Provence. While I'll miss them a lot, I crave for this lovely view we had from the kitchen table while eating our freshly baked bread
from the homed farmed wheat. As Granddad use to call those lovely little red boats floating on the only sea he could take back
with him to the hills of Provence. Arrogant, thanks to the bliss of ignorance of life that anyone who just left teenage has, I decide to
grow a small replica of the farms fields and view on my balcony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later I would not have gone for such an undertaking to have a wheat field on a city twentieth floor terrace. To reduce the risks,
I take some earth from my grand parents farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My kids just mentioned out loud what I had not wants to admit to myself yet: while the yearly crop as we call it from our terrace
grows well it looks like we may not even have one summer ball as the kids call the decoration that I like to see in my summer wheat. How
we moved to call them summer balls echoing the christmas tree balls instead of red boats like my granddad i have lost track over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I know for sure however, is that over the last years they have grown rarer and rarer but would never have considered spending a
summer without seeing one from the window. The simple idea of doing a 'harvest' without having to remove some decorations' away
is so unacceptable for the whole family that we decided to go for a hunt in the country side in the coming weekends to restore the
balance of life on our balcony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My granddad often told us about the the first family trip to the wild as we called it to find some summer paper balls for our
balcony wheat production which we would use to make pancake on the following Mardi gras. While the first years it was fairly easy
to find them and bring them back as the years passed it became incredibly dificult to find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this was the main reason for me to go and become a world expert on hydroponic culture taking the science beyond what had been considered for decades the human staples necessities, I learned long after that we hadnt been the only one noticing their new rarity and that many more than me had started trying to grow them artificially to cater for the world demand from the richest people who now also wanted to see those summer decorations in their garden or, to my horror, in vases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of unsuccessful attempts at applying all the science I had learned I decided to go back to the origin of this family tradition, in this farm my great-great grand father had in Provence, hoping to recognise it from one of the many summer paintings from the house and the garden view we all have in the family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few months, I find the land which had been since declared unfit for habitation in an attempt to help rebuild the primal forest which stopped a few kilometres away on the slope of the Sainte Victoire mountain near the small town of Saint-Maximin. Family blessing or luck, I find a few of those still growing on a small glade which somehow is a remain of all the fields the family once had. Torn between taking them with me and leaving this last bit of untouched nature, I settle for taking earth samples with me and some seeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year later I have succeeded to grow some of those seeds on the earth sample and can now start further experiments on why they have been so dificult to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another decade spent and I just cannot believe my findings. All the data now point to one single parameter: this little red sparkles
which used to grow in our fields only can do so if they had been battle fields. The human blood leaves some traces in the ground
which are needed for the seed to germinate. May be the english somehow knew this when they selected it as a symbols of war com-
memorations and a call for peace hundreds or so years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Hollywood ending: Anyway thanks to this finding and the huge impact of this visual indicator on the mind the UN passed a further
settlement for peace keeping which should prevent those wild flowers from flowering again and now we can keep them growing in tubes
as we do not need another blood shade in our fields for them to come back again)&lt;/p&gt;
