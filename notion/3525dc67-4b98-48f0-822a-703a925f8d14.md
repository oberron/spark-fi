# Missing cats


For decades some humans claimed  to have been abducted by aliens 

But for much longer had beloved cats disappeared from their home to never return 

Until one day when the next gen of satellite based cat tracking chips were deployed

Abducted cats were detected in low eart orbits

As the true intelligent specie on Earth, they were the ones studied

Humans abduction was just a glitch in the latest generation sensors used by aliens, hence horns quick release back on the planet.
