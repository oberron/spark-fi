“Yes, a Centaur's strength flows from the Force and Wisdom. But beware of the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, and you’ll be known as one Atilla’s Huns or Kambojas”

recently deciphered linear A tablet - dated ~1500 BC
