# The cat’s judgement


When the soul came to be judged, Osiris did not pay attention to the cat.

But when the cat started tilting the scale, Osiris angrily said 

“Who art thou to interfere, we are yet undecided if the soul is pure enough and need to weigh it against this feather!”

The cat miaowed back

“I’m Schrödinger’s cat, trust me I know all there is to know about undiciseveness”
