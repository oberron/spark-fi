> Father, is it true that little fairies look after our garden and dance in it when we donâ€™t look?   

> Yes they do and you should be careful not to try to look at them!   

> But why, I want to!!!!   

> They evolved the same as we do. Your granddad could look at them in his youth, but now though they are tiny,
