# Sumerian DNA


For decades archaeologists had debunked the theory that helix depictions in Sumerian tablets were indications Sumerian had knowledge of the DNA helix. After all they did not have the tools to see it…

Then, in a submerge cave they discovered a temple dedicated to Gilgamesh and rolls of thin sheets of gold covered in cuneiform. For long archaeologists classified this as gibberish until a biologist by trade read those and understood that they talked about octopus whose unique genetic complexity makes them standout.

Piecing those together he realised that Octopus were the guardians of Mu’s knowledge. The vast variety of DNA in octopus was “just” data written in DNA for long term archiving. And to ensure this data would remain easily available they had embedded it in the coding DNA of their best friend
