When all humans and animals were created, they each had a role and function to accomplish. Bees where responsible to fertilise flowers, 
elephants were gardeners of the savana, and each of the human species also had a role. Elves where the plant diplomats for all the animal kingdom, 
Dwarves were the diplomats of the mineral world for all plants and animal kingdom, Neanderthals were in charge of keeping the balance between all
animals, Denisovans were in charge of navigating the sea and to be the diplomats between land and sea dweling animals, ...  and the smallest of all humans;
*homo-disciplus* (the man who studies) - was charged with learning about the world and recording any learnings reported to them.

But the snake thought that if the world was less harmonious it would be able to eat a bigger share than it had been allowed. The snake was keen on 
smuthering food to eat more and faster. So it went to homo-disciplus and said:   
"You have been learning for so long, you do not have anything new to learn. You should call your self *homo-sapiens* (the man who knows) no need for learning. Stop
calling yourself *homo-disciplus*"

Sadly, they listened to the snake...
