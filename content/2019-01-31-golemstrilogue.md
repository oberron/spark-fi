For years his dreamed were filled of golems in shiny metallic armors. 

One day, wandering in dreamland, he found a the factory which made those shiny golems. The walls of the factories were engraved with:

> Thou shall not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.   
> Thou must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with above
> Thou must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with above »

He woke-up petrified until somehow he knew that only one word could free him.

« Roooobotttts » was the only thing that came from his lungs.
Then his mother came:
"Isaac, are you alright? »
