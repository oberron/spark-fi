As soon as Merlin held the Holy Grail, he knew that the Age of Magic had reached an end.

Merlin's first experiments drew immediate attention from astrologers, alchemists and their crowds. 
As the experiments grew more and more powerful, a rebellion formed led by the Lady of the Lake. 
Soon enough Camelot was under siege.

Pressed for time, Merlin took a first sip from the cup to divert the energy of planets and stars from astrologers to Gallileo and his heirs. 
Exhausted from this and hit by a charm he started drinking a second sip, transposing the energy of lighting and metals from alchemists to Newton and his scions.
Before being done, as the gates of his laboratory were shaking under the assaults of the queen of magic. Merlin had no choice but to stop the transfer and send the calice into hidding.

To this day the heirs of Vivianne, though now powerless, are looking for the Holy Grail and scientists wonder why science can be so clear for everything except quantum physics.
