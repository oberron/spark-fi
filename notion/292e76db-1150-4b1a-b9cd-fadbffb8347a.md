# Hallucinations 


Humanity spent the first half of the XXI first century trying to prevent AI from hallucinating.

But one scientist, who broke the family tradition of being shamans turned this upside down.

He created slow and fast AIs and used the slow one to filter only for hallucinations and used those to challenge humanity consensus on as many topics as he could in his life.

Since then any overarching consensus has to be exposed to the now called Shaman’s mushrooming beard which goes hand in hand with Accam’s razor
