# the red riding hood - revisited 


Juliette often like dressing in red to go and visit her friend Lawrence. But she would tell her mum she was going to see her Nany in the woods to get a basket of food.

But really all she was trying was to get attention from Romeo whose family was despised by hers and often called the barbarian or the wolves.
