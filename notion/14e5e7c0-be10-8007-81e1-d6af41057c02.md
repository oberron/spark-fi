# Fermi’s teenagers parameter


In the field of exobiology, Fermi’s equation was long considered the best way to approximate the likelihood of alien civilisation which humanity could establish contact with.

For long humanity pondered as to why none seem to exist despite the high probability given by Fermi’s equation.

Until one day after the first contact with alien the answer came:

“You did not account for the teenage factor: most advanced civilisation cannot keep how terrible teenagers are from the next generation, so most collapse regardless of their technological prowess”
