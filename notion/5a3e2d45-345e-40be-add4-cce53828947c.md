# Vaccine cover


#conspiracy

When the inner circle heard that the virus they had worked on for so long had escaped the laboratory, they feared a possible class action. If an investigation proved the lethal effects were from their gain of function work, it could be disastrous for their reputation.

A crisis team was formed on how to best mitigate the impact in the share holders value and keep stock prices rising. For weeks they worked round the clock going through different scenarios.

Until one evening, late into the night, a junior in charge of bringing pizzas saw the board, paused and innocently asked:

> How about finding a way to force everyone to be injected  with a vaccine which would have similar side effect? 

> We could have a contract protecting the labs from class action under national emergency laws and then they could not sue us either for the lab leak since no one could prove if damages were from vaccine or virus !

The seniors and executives remained silent for almost a minute.

The rest is historyâ€¦
