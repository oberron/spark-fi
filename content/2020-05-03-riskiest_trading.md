# Risky Trading

December 24th, 2018.. Somewhere near Arkham, New England the phone rings in the middle of the night

\- "John, our internal auditors just realised we are dangerously exposed on commodities

\- Why do you bother me on Christmas eve, we have always traded agresively on commodities. Especially corn, oil and butter yield 
good results. I hope it's not the ghost of future time and fear of some poor farmers dying of hunger in Africa that made you wake me up?

\- John, please... We've started this together decades ago. This time it is much worse. We bet on high volatility of commodities but someone stupidly bet on the wrong commodity... Toilet roll paper..."

A long silence followed, then a cavernous voice answered:

\"- A pandemic would fix this, creating high surge demand for toilet roll paper faster than supply could accommodate. Find a 
Biosafety Lab with the most dangerous diseases, a P4. Make sure something highly contagious escapes..."

\- John, We'll be bankrupt... in 18 months. Excessive bets on high price volatility for toilet roll

A cavernous voice answered:

\- A pandemic would fix this. Find a BSL P4 and get something highly contagious to escapes
