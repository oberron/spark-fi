# Of Frogs and Rosbeefs


As far back as memories went, the two tribes had always lived on their respective side of the river. 

The Roastbeef always joked at the Froggies carrying a frog with them, thinking the griddy neighbours always carried a live snack.

Until one summer when all the Roastbeef got riddled with diseases carried by mosquitoes but their neighbours didnâ€™t: the frogs were used as active mosquitoes protection
