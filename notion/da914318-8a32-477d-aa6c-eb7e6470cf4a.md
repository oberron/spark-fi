# A knot from the stars


when the alien ship was discovered shortly before crashing on Venus, even the starchiest believers in Alien life had long died out.

A long mission was launched to find the ship on the unfriendly Venus. But then, when they saw the signs of damage which could not be explained neither by atmospheric entry, nor by asteroids, Humanity realised  grave dangers were lurking out there.

The team assembled struggled to make any sense of what they found, until Camille a young scientist, truly the Champolion of this era realised they didnâ€™t use arithmetics.  They seem to use knots and topology as the base for everything, and then still a weird version which only some strangely trained deep neural networks could replicate.
