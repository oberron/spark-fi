The first time traveller got nearly turned into a stew when he arrived at the stone ages. 
He was only saved by luck when showing kids who were kicking a moss ball how to dribble, Man-U songs and tagging.

30,000 years later archeologues still wonder why humans started painting on cave walls but they often ridicule football fans.
