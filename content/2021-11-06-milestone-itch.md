When the roman retired from England, the Angles and Saxon moved in and attack the visible signs of roman presence. They burned what they could, destroyed the rest and sometimes settled in the old masters palaces.
After a while, however they settled. Little did they know the power of the milestones.
They tried to take them down or move them. But the stones kept on coming back to their place.
Milestones were stubborn little things, they did not mind moving to see new placed when moss itched, but they definitively did not like being moved by humans...
