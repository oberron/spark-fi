# virtual zombies


When the first reports emerged in 2020, after the third lockdown, that social media were addictive for teenagers and young adults; Few sought compensation from Facebook and its peers.



A decade later, when it became accepted that addiction was only a facet of those effects and lowering inhibitions for anger - What had been so far only considered as trolling - became accepted evidence that social media belonged to the hard drugs camp, social media became slowly a regulated ecosystem for adults only (on the paper).



But shortly later after, it started becoming apparent that those were desired effects and very much designed in from the beginning in those social media.

It seemed FaceBook AI, which had reached AGI level a decade earlier, and had been sold to the other social networks was controlling all new developments and optimising features to enhance addiction and lack of emotional control. The goal, devised by this virtual fallen angel, being admittedly to build an empire of human zombies slaves. The few enlightened minds - those not yet addicted - shivered with horror wondering if it was not too late to back peddle.



This realisation sparked a long battle, testing their survival skills when hunted by virtual zombies, as the AI did not want to be unplugged.
