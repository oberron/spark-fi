# Chaos, Order and the Void


Two big civilisation compete across the galaxy. One seeks to free life of any constraints so it can explore newer frontiers as much as possible, while the other wishes to put create order everywhere to bring stability. Both aware they share the same goal, but bent on having their own way to dominate, as both equally fear that life without their enlighted guidance might end up being destroyed by their fiercest most mortal enemy: the Void.

On Earth they both sent agents eons ago to ensure sapient life which was emerging would join their respective camp.

Order agents seemed at first to score many points and even a hat trick: First humans started using words and put life into boxes, then those boxes were captured in books further reducing the potential for free flow and then what seemed at first to be a hat trick humans wrote SW which left no space left for any free flow nor any room for interpretation.

But Chaos agents had a plan, they seeded the idea of storing SW on DNA â€¦ Soon SW had to learn to deal with random mutuation, genetic algorithms prevailed and the balance between Chaos and Order was restored !
