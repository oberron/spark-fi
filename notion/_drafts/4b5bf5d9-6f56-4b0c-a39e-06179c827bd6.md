# natural leaders


notes from luc ferran on radio classique on 2024-06-03

only in sports and music are natural leaders regularly renewed at the top.

the most talented reach the top (only true in music and sport)

they donâ€™t work, they practice.

work implies effort against natural tendency.



Questions:

 is this true?

is it falsifiable?
