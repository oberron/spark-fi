# The map is not the territory, but what is the L3 cache of the territory ?


The map is not the territory, but is the map the L3 cash of the territory



Map isnâ€™t territory because the word is not the thing, the abstract is not concrete

But is even the territory the territory ?

How does the map and the ship of Theseus intercept ?

The map is a 2D model of a 4D reality.
