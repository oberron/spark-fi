# Cat 9 3/4


Schroedingers cat has long left the box and was now working at Kings Cross train station. 

What few knew is that everyone who attempts to go through the wall will land on platform 9 3/4. It just if they are observed by cat that they will stay.

The cats job was to observe magicians and ignore muggles.
