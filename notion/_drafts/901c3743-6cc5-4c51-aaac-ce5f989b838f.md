# Jack and the bean - revisited


Jack lived with his mum and they had a small busines. The dad had subscribed a life insurance and the proceed allowed them to make ends meet.

But when Jack turned of age he cashed in on the fund thinking he could invest in the family business to make it profitable.

But en route he read an ad for bitcoin and instantly bought those.

As he came home he told his mum about and she cried they were ruined without any chance to pay the bills anymore.

Thankfully over the weekend the bitcoin value grew exponentially!
