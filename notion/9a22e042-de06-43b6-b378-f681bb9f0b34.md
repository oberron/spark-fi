# Ghosts Neighbours


The first time the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, a radio astronomical research agency) notification alarm rang, it created havoc in the dorms. Nearly a year of sleepless nights searching for the extraterrestrial reading, they realised the sensors had been triggered by a leaky microwave oven, in the rest room near the sensing room.*

So when it rang again, almost on the day of the anniversary of the first alarm. Every one thought it was a bad joke. However they quickly realised the sensors were actually, partially powered off for maintenance and so should not have triggered an alarm at all.

So began  a decade long scientific investigation. For budget reasons, it was nearly stopped a dozen times. Yet, years later humanity made first contact with an unknown very refined civilisation. 

The ancient Chinese had called them **"鬼" (guǐ)**, ancient Mesopotamia “gidim” and Western Europeans referred to them as ghosts. 

The most visible members of those neighbours had simply, for millennia, been mistaken by humans as our dead ones…
