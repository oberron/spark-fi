The philosopher meditating under a tree was wondering    
> [â€œif a tree falls but no one is there to hear it, does it make a noise ?"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest)
    
In the meantime the forest was discussing with the wind and the birds:    

> if a human reflects in the forest but does not teach a student, 
> is he thinking ?
