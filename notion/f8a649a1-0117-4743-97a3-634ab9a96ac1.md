# Al-babel-t


As humans were building the Tower of Babel the most common work song was « Aleph Bet (1) 🎶🎵 “,  ‘the Home’s Ox’.

So right after God destroyed the tower, and divided their language, they rebelliously set schools to learn each others language. Quickly realising this was easiest if they used the Aleph-Bet song as a mutual ground.

So God sent one last Angel to muddle the song in their minds. Besides the first two words nothing made sense anymore.

Soon they could only remember having to learn the alpha-bet at school but had forgotten why.

So they spread around the earth, but even eons later their heirs still go to school to learn the alphabet singing “A B C🎶”.



1: alphabet : refers to aleph - bet from old Semitic resp. Ox + Home, which became Alpha-Beta when passed into Greek.
