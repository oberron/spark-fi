4 billion years ago a cargo carrying dangerous bio waste passed earth.

in a life critical situation the cargo has to be discharged to save millions of life in the spaceship.

the bio hazard waste container landed on Earth and leaked self replicating double h√©lices molecules.

the entire branch of the Galaxy was declared a NO-GO zone for 7 billoon years to avoid possuble contamination of other existunf lufe forms.

recent reports seem to indicate the planet has started emitting radio waves triggering a wave of worry in galactic government circles.
