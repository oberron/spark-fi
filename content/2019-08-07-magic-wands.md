He was a very happy man. In his trade, being the last magician making magic wands, he was a vert respected magician.
His grand children, as many others, were lively and often made him smile (especially when they were a few meters away).
Until one day, his wife said:

> stop playing with magic wands and entertain your grand-kids.

Perplexed he sat with them, trying to figure out what entertaining young kids could mean.

For days he let them pull his beard, undo the knot of his shoes, paint on his face with charcoal... 

Then one night he woke up suddendly, went to his laboratory, modified the artifact he had inherited for wand making and produce the first lot of very small wands for kids. he had replaced dragon scales or unicorn hair with colored clay.

for weeks his grand kids discovered the joy of colouring and he felt releaved not to loose hair by the handful anymore.

until when the next order for magic wand came, ... 

he realised sudendly that moving on the only magic possible, once the last magic wand would run out magic, was kids doing colouring as he had modified the artifact beyond the point of return.
