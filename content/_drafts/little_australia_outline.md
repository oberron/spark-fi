Little Australia

Characters
Key Charcter: Massimo. Brilliant journalist (failed jesuit priest) and amateur opera singer. Well travelled. Recently came back to France for moral reasons (did not like how commercial journalism was evolving in NY). Looks a lot like Don Camillio.
Side kick: ??? (actually Massimo's daugther but he nor the reader knows at first). Very good but full of herself and extremly arrogant. She looks a lot like Scully in X-Files.

story line:
opening scene: scary chase with yet to be identified character chased by "red intelligent eyes" to be later identified as kangaroos

Initial situation:
Massimo struggling in Paris to find jobs as "pigist" paid per article

Disruption: Summer holiday all key journalist gone and some weird epidemy starting in Rambouillet affecting more and more teenagers found in Persistent vegetative state.

Action:
Massimo arrives in Rambouillet fighting the local "upper class" which wants to keep a tight lead on this story but finds help in the middle/low class which are worried that since their kids cannot leave for summer camps abroad are more likely to be exposed.
Massimo's side kick thanks to her mother's relation helps him (though not willingly) identify that most bodies were found in the part of the forest were the kangaroos live in the wild.

Resolution:
While Massimo going through his old contacts finds correlatino between the medical files and a condition called "intellectual shock" which is a "alternative truth" case, M's side kick establishes that some of the first kids had just come back from Australia and were known drug dealers.

Conclusion:
While Massimo tries some aborigenes medicine trick to remove the "intellectual shock" condition his side kick convinces doctors to proceed to a blood dialysis to remove drugs which could not be detected but might be present.
While no one believes either dialysis or aborigenes' tricks can work the kids end up waking up.

We end learning from M's side kick when "reporting" to her mum that she is actually M's daughter.
