One of the secret project of Jeff Bezos was [Archaeoacoustics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeoacoustics), he believed that sounds encoded into the clay as the pot was thrown could 
one day be played-back allowing us to listen to conversations of ancient greeks, egyptians and mayans.

Unfortunately the voice of humans is too weak to be recorded.

So he directed the team to focus on Ἰθάκη, one of the oldest populated island of the Mediteranean sea and birth place of Ulysses.
Some legends also place the craddle of the mermaid civilisation on this island. 

The first successes unfortunately led the first scientific teams to madness until someone found a way to cover the singings 
with a normal human voice. 

The voice was adictive but did not drive visible signs of madness.

Years later they deciphered the language used, the first voice they could play-back was from a mermaid called Alexa...
