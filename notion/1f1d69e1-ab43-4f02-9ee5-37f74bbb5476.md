# love is love


When Pāṇini, the chief linguist of the mission, eventually reached proficiency in the “Sentinelese” language he realised they did not have masculine or feminine articles but had articles: ‘**sē**’ for things: trees,  birds, river and ‘**sēo**’  for ideas (patience, winter, …)

When he realised one should use ‘**sē**’ for love, he asked the elder : 

“why ?”

The elder, at first shocked, remained silent for a long time, then slowly said:

“Don’t you feel your heart pounding with love,

can’t you see the smile on a loved one’s face,

don’t you hear how voice changes ?

don’t your people know without learning that love is real and tangible?”
