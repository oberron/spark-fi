# Dusty broom


The witch had just received the message from her motherâ€™s crow. So she jumped on the broom to fly to her rescue.

Alas, she was a mischief witch she always kept her home clean and well dusted.

So when it came to fly all night long, her broom was not charged with enough dust for such a long fly and she had to do an emergency landing.

There is a reason witches keep their houses unruly: pixy dust collected in their homes is needed to charges their brooms before they fly!
