# neo-shamans


when Gaia emerged from the longest dream a shaman ever under took, the cave was silent. Shamans had travelled from all over the known world to ward her dream from interruptions.

She slowly adjusted back to her body, the hesitantly got ready to share what she had seen.

How could she explain what she had seen ?

The shamans were concerned that the network of life exchanges they had cared for generations was being more and more captured by abstract aberrations that humans called gods. As if the Creator’s world could be the product of selfish entities like Zeus or Hares ?

So Gaia told them: “i don’t know what this means, but as i travelled the dream world ali guide time, less and less dreams contained elements of nature but it seems a some point the start again seeing the spirituality and start dreaming again of spirits but they seem to call the corporations?”
