# My name is  No One


for millennia story tellers counted myths, long after night fall, as the last ashes were casting their last glimmers of light of a sly hero escaping a trap by saying “My Name is No One”

What few beyond their order knew was that their stories were all variants of the mother of stories.

In those days story tellers were part of a secret order, all had trained the same way and all had been told the same story before being told to go and spread stories to their fellow human beings, as the believed feeding imagination helped escape the pain of empty stomachs.

All variants of this last story go like this:

A long time ago, when most humans could still understand animals and when humans did not stand alone in two legs, came the one whose name meant fire-carrier. He brought the knowledge of fire making from clans to clans, how to cook meat and stayed long enough with each clan until kids started asking for stories to fall asleep around the fire. His stories were tells of animals playing tricks to each others, to humans and other two legged ones. But if asked for his name he’d answer my name is no one and would be good before dawn. 

Many clans tried chasing him, but how hard was it to explain they were chasing No him to thank him“
