The exhausted parents kept on calling the god mother fairy for help to look after the kids.

After years, the exhausted and angry god mother, waived her wand, and made appear a magic hypnotic window.

She then called out in a loud voice:

> You will have peace until they are teenagers,
> but until then, everytime you close the hypnotic window you will regret it!
