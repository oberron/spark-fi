"* Thou shall not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.   
* Thou must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with above
* Thou must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with above »

He woke-up petrified until somehow he knew that only one word could free him.

« Roooobotttts » was the only thing that came from his lungs.
Then his mother came:
"Isaac, are you alright? »
