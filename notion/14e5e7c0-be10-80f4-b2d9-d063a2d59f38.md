# Etiquette 


Master, why have we never answered the humans? They keep on ansking on the waves “is on anyone there”. Isn’t that an un-ethical?”

The master paused, the question rarely came in ethics but deserved a carefully crafted answer both in verbal and non verbal forms!

“You are right it’s un-ethical. But as the grand-masters of etiquette keep on reminding us, it would take us so many lifetimes to go and visit them - once after we started exchanging- that we wouldn’t be able to honour those courtesy visits that we are already committed to.

 So not answering is the polite thing to do!“
