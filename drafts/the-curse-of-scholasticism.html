  <h1>The curse of scholasticism</h1>

   <h1>The curse of scholasticism</h1>
<p>In the first dawn, before the rivers had carved their beds and before the winds had chosen their directions, the animals gathered in a circle of silence. For they knew something strange was coming: the creator was gifting them a creature unlike any before, a being who would walk upright, and whose spirit would hunger for more than survival: the Shepard of His creation.</p>
<p>When the first human infant cried out, the animals stepped forward, each bearing a gift.</p>
<p>The Elders of the Apes shuffled in with their wrinkled wisdom. They looked upon the fragile creatures and said:</p>
<p>“These one must shape the world, not only move through it.”</p>
<p>They pressed their palms upon the child and said “we will teach them to use their opposing thumbs, so the humans might grasp, hold, and build.</p>
<p>The Whales, dreaming even as they sang, rose from the seas. They breathed mist over the cradle and said “may our songs gave the gift of dreams, so that when humans slept, their minds could travel where their bodies could not, and their vision would stretch beyond the horizon”.</p>
<p>The Beavers scurried forward with teeth sharp as chisels. They promised:</p>
<p>“We shall teach them how to tame water, how to make still lakes where life multiplies.”</p>
<p>And thus, they gifted the art of building and channeling waters.</p>
<p>The Sheep stepped shyly from the meadows and laid soft fleece beside the child.</p>
<p>“Let them never be naked before the winter winds. Let them weave warmth from my wool.”</p>
<p>The animals formed a circle of protection, careful that none who bore ill intent would enter. The Snake hissed at the edges, whispering promises of division from nature, but the others barred it away.</p>
<p>Yet they overlooked the Jackal, companion of the serpent. As the gathering dispersed, he crept near. With cunning eyes, he touched the newborn’s brow and planted the seed of scholastic bias: the urge to believe in invisible entities as though they were more real than soil and rain. This would drive humanity to cling to ideas above fact, chasing shadows as truths, opening them to foreshadow Love for the Creator.</p>
<p>Only the Owl, keeper of silent wisdom, saw this treachery. She swooped low and brushed her wingtip across the child’s chest.</p>
<p>“Not all will be lost. Some will seek truth with experiment and observation, weighing what is real against what is wished.”</p>
<p>And so, humans were born blessed and burdened: able to name the world, to dream beyond it, but also to mistake names for truths and shadows for substance.</p>
<p><strong>The Morale</strong></p>
<p>Thus the struggle began: humanity would forever wrestle between naming and knowing, between belief and understanding. Every step forward would be slowed by illusions they themselves invented. Perhaps the Tree of Knowledge was not the tree of wisdom at all, but the Tree of Naming—a tree that clothed the world in labels, sometimes blinding humans to the living reality beneath.</p>
<p>And the lesson whispers still: to know is not to name, and to name is not to know.</p>
<p>The snake’s work being to misrepresent the tree of naming for the tree of knowledge and having humans eat from it.</p>
