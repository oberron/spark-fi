Romeo loved Juliette and she loved him.

But she lived on a planet located within the higher dimensions of the solar system.

They had met while their conscious were drifting, and kept meeting, as soon as their mentors were distracted.

But however strong their love, they could not challenge the established order which had put planets in some random dimensions amongst the different 11 possible. 

Astronomers on each of their respective planet could feel the masses of the other planets. some called them dark matter and others heaven, but none could see each other in the physical world.
